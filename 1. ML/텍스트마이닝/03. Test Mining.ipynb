       "'I loved it, so good Phone was not what I ordered, very disappointed. Will not order again. I was really mad at first because I thought I bought a broken phone. Phone works they gave me a charger that was no good After a recent bad experience with a different phone from another company, I was skeptical about trying another uncommon brand. I\\'m very happy to say it has everything I wanted and so far it works perfectly. I\\'m loving this phone, especially for the price! The only major downfall I\\'ve found with this phone is that they don\\'t make phone cases for it. However, I did order a belt clip case so I at least have somewhere to safely carry it. Everything ok No conecta bien .Agarra pobre señal. At first, the phone looks nice, and without the OTA update, can be used. After the system update, weird apps are automatically installed, demanding certain settings, which will bombard you with unwanted advertising and, weird communication to the Internet. The Chinese firmware doesn\\'t make it possible to disable, or remove this bloatware, and if you disable the USB security app, you have to go through the entire wizard with every restart.If you love your earned money and your privacy, I suggest you find another brand, that does take your privacy seriously. Love otterbox, but this one did not fit the 5s :( received a full refund, excellent customer service! The phones are not high quality, but they are affordable and good starter phones for kids. Awesome phone at a ver affordable price Love it best phone I have owned yet 😊☺ the phone has a damage in the charging connect, i had to buy a desktop charger, I\\'m not satisfaid with the product. Great cell phone, delivered on time and qith all the accesories.i didn t have any problem with the seller. IN LOVE I get compliments about my case often and it doesn\\'t fade or get dingy Phone was nice but there wasn\\'t headphone Excellent watch thanks it work great as a phone my son love it and use everyday also use as and ipod completely satisfied with this purchase. Bad. Is refurbish.. i\\'m very annoying. I\\'ve had this phone for five months and I am rating it three stars because of its questionable durability. I have dropped it a couple of times and I think that may be why neither the vibration function nor the front-facing camera no longer work. However I truly appreciate the Bluetooth function for my car infotainment system and I appreciate the WiFi for my Chargepoint ap so that I can remotely cease charging my car. I normally don\\'t buy extended warrenties for electronics, but I wish that I had for this. I don\\'t like this phone, it is too slow pictures quality poor. And I need to send it back I have had a Android for the past 6 years. I can\\'t remember the last Blackberry model I had, but I remember I loved it. If you\\'re looking something for productivity, this is the device for you. I don\\'t play games and I don\\'t care about apps. All I care about are phone calls, text messages, my calendar, and email. This device is better than anything out there for those applications. Call quality is far superior to any android I have owned. It is nice to have buttons to call and hangup. The keyboard is great, I forgot how much I had missed it. Not having to charge the phone during the day is even better. This thing lasts all day with out any problems. I can not say this for any Android device I\\'ve owned. Now, for the con\\'s. It has limited app support presently. If you\\'re into apps, this may not be the device for you. If you don\\'t care about apps, this probably is the device for you. So far I love it. The build quality is better than any other phone out there. The phone sucks Works great.....quick shipper....just as described. I got to say after 5 days of use, I absolutely love this phone. The small compact size is perfect for me and I don\\'t mind the thickness, I assume it\\'s thicker than most to put that bigger battery in. I thought it would be hard to go small since I\\'m coming from the iPhone 6 Plus, but wasn\\'t bad at all in my opinion. This is actually the first android phone that I can say I won\\'t be going back to my iPhone. I get about 1 1/2 days of battery life at moderate use. so far my screen on time averages 4 hours, best was 4 hours 45 minutes. My last android phone was the 2015 moto x pure and that battery life was horrible along with others I have owned, nexus 5x, Htc one m7, m8, m9, nexus 5, and so on which always made me go back to my iPhone along with other reasons. I am in the United States and with At&t and can confirm LTE works perfectly. No issues at all. Also I didn\\'t have to manually put in the APN for mms or Internet to work, u just make sure u have wifi connected and then go to settings, then more, then scroll down and hit internet settings. Hit download and it will automatically download the correct settings for your carrier, make sure your carrier sim is installed. The camera is good enough for me, I\\'m no professional photographer so I just leave it in superior auto mode and it takes good pics in my opinion. I can confirm the phone back does get a little warm during some situations. First one was downloading all my apps from the play store at the same time. 2nd is using hangouts for video calls, other than that it has been fine. The heat it did get did not burn my hand and was still comfortable to hold and use. I did get the DP glass screen protector which I put on all my phones and I like it. I\\'m not a case kind of guy so waiting on my dbrand skin. I did get the white version and I have not had any screen issues or my on screen buttons not working on my bed. I assume others just got a defective unit. I got usb cord, earbuds, and a international plug in the box. Just a side not I only have one hand and am super happy that a company actually makes a one handed device with great specs. Most android phones I\\'ve had one handed use was very difficult if not impossible but had no choice if wanted top specs, so thank you Sony for high end specs in a compact size. Replacing an existing phone! Wonderful I thought it only had one scratch as described but it had an noticeable crack at the corners Very good. A great buy for anyone willing to spend not excessively for a smartphone yet get the taste of smartphone world. I gave this as a gift to my uncle. He loves it now. realy Great EXCELENT PHONE. PERFECT CONDITIONS excellent phone! Great phone. Kinda to big... I bought this phone mainly for taking photos (great quality), even got there camera attach kit cost me $$$ and 32Gb SD card. Phone BROKE after 3 month. Very rarely used as well, a Blue screen with code when I turn on, please help! Or refund!! BAD BUY BE AWARE I love it, I do recommend it. Can\\'t get picture/sms messages on T mobile network. Have to try another carrier. Great Phone! Value for money. You won\\'t be disappointed. It was exactly what I wanted and what it said it was, few very minor scuffs but basically brand new and works perfectly so far.. The company it came from was nice to put two chargers and a set of earbuds in with it, made a really good impression on me to go to them again Awesome Excellent product arrived in time indicated My mother loves it! She raves and raves about this phone and then shows it off to everyone she meets. Perfect phone! Amazing! Fast response,long batery duration time, beautiful display! The active display let me forget to unlock by pressing power button.Wonderful touchless control! Hope android 5.0 upgrade! I am a little disappointment because when I reviewed thew red mode, it doesn\\'t have 4G option and the description it has!! :(otherwise the phone is very nice. The display will fade away after 3 seconds of use. I don\\'t know if this usually happens but this has to change. I can barely see what\\'s going on. excelent WHEN I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT IT WAS BECAUSE THE ITEM MODEL WAS RCN72UW, WHICH WORKS WITH THE 3G BANDS THAT I NEED. THIS PHONE WAS BOUGHT FOR INTERNATIONAL USE SO THE MODEL OFFERED WAS SIPPOSED TO BE ALRIGHT. ONCE I TOOK THE PHONE TO VENEZUELA (THE COUNTRY WHERE THIS WAS GOING TO BE USED) I REALIZED THAT IT WAS NOT THE STYLE ON THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION. SO IT IS BEING USED AS A 2G PHONE. THE SELLER TOLD ME TO SEND IT BACK BUT IT WAS ALREADY IN VENEZUELA SO IT WOULD BE TOO EXPENSIVE TO RETURN THE PRODUCT. Great! Works like new Excellent phone!! It took a while to get it but let me tell you that it was a great purchase. Easy to operate, speakers in the right place with full functionality. I recommend this phone to anyone looking to upgrade! My third otterbox, and a big disappointment - I really liked the fingerprint unlock feature of the S5. You can\\'t use it with this case. The sensor is very particular (which is a good thing), and this case does not allow swiping with a flat finger, so the sensor fails to allow me in every time. I had to switch to a PIN. I also had to remove the screen protector. It collected dust underneath. Lastly, it\\'s really hard to keep the rubber case in place. It likes to come off the hard case in places. Don\\'t waste your $$$ and posh\\'s customer service is horrible & unco\\'operative Good phone,good price,come in on time . I bought this phone to have it shipped to Venezuela as a present for my brother. When he turn it on, it asked him for a code. This phone was sold as a locked to a carrier phone. Now I have to spend money out of my pocket to have it jailbreak so that he can use it there. Very disappointed with this purchase. I had a couple Otterbox over the years and loved them all. Not this one. The fingerprint reader is covered and the white housing picks up a nasty gray color after a couple weeks of use. Unit arrived ok and appears to be functional. The charger however had no compatible plug (male) and I am still not able to charge it without borrowing someone\\'s charger. My son loves it even tho I had to send the other one back & received another one... excelent It\\'s big, it\\'s bold and this one is blue. Not much to complain about because everything I dislike about this phone was clearly mentioned in the description so can\\'t say I was unaware.CONS:screen resolutionsystem memoryspeakers (worst of any phone I\\'ve ever had) even with earphones/budssize...too bigPROS:battery life (best of any phone I\\'ve ever owned)service, despite being only a 3G HSPA phone driving around downtown and going into tunnels I\\'ve yet to lose GPS signal which in my book is awesome, service signal is also top notch, I get 2-3 bars in places where people I\\'ve been with lose their signal completely.size...I know I know, I also listed this under the cons, but its a double edge sword, on the one hand the immense size can at times be some what inconvenient doesn\\'t fit properly in pants pockets, hard to find cases (that\\'s true with all BLU phones though), but when watching videos on youtube or movies or using the google maps its always good to have a bigger screen so take it for what its worth. I like the phone it does everything other high end phones do at a fraction of the price but don\\'t expect it to perform just as good, for it\\'s price range and size you can\\'t go wrong. It arrived defective Bought it from Wireless Everything. They had good ratings overall which encouraged me. Very vast shipping. Phone came with a U.S. electricity power supply, no international sockets although it came with a separate international adapter outside the phone box. No seal on the box but the phone was brand new with all wrapping. When turned on, the language was defaulted to English U.S., you just click OK. Color looks fantastic, way better than white or blue. Phone made in China, not Korea, or at least this color. I hope it hold for a while. Not sure yet about the quality of the battery. I will update my review in few weeks. Works with MetroPCS, T-mobile, and AT&T.I hope SONY will provide the Android 4.4 (KitKat) for this model soon.Picture is great, movie is great, and sound is great!The quality of display is really great too!Battery life could get really short if you use navigation, music, and drive recorder at the same time.(drive recorder program installed separately), I bought this for development (not an apple fan) but it does everything just fine. Finally a phone that doesn\\'t make me crazy. Have ditched my overpriced Samsung Galaxy S6 that never worked properly for this perfectly good replacement that didn\\'t cost the moon. Totally satisfied. Amazon accidentally boxed the colors wrong, so I received a white phone -- twice -- when I had ordered a black one, but I decided I didn\\'t care enough to return it a second time. (The actual sellers -- BuyeRush -- were super-responsive and helpful, though, and would gladly have facilitated things had I held out for a black one.) i dont reall like what i receive cos the phone dont have a charge and battery, and the person who sale the phone did not put or say the phone did not have such item, then pls adviced people dat post phone on ur site to make sure the write what they have or how the product it so that when any buyer will no what is buying, pls tell hime to sent me the charge and the battery so dat the phone will be complete, thanks I\\'ve had this phone for about 5 months now and it is my 1st smart phone. Battery life is short when browsing via WiFi or with cell data. I don\\'t do spybook just check email and other simple stuff. Camera is OK if you have bright light if you need to depend on flash forget it. Video tends to blur a lot with movement. Call quality is OK. I did take case off and make mike hole and protective cover hole bigger now most people can hear me. OS is very stable it rarely locks up if so just restart the app. I would buy this again and recommend it to a person who doesn\\'t need a lot of apps and is just a basic phone user. Price is right. very good deal I wanted a cell phone with a QWERTY keyboard, and that\\'s what I got. The wifi connection is spotty and drops repeatedly. The apps for Facebook and Twitter worked on Day1 and haven\\'t worked again since (two weeks ). I have never been able to access the Internet. My 2004 Samsung clamshell, which I replaced with this one, was more intuitive. Serious buyer\\'s remorse. Takes hours to charge (3-5hours). Pretty basic phone. Not that great. I just received the phone and have been using it only for one day. To put things in perspective, I bought this unlocked phone to cover for my broken Samsung S5, so my phone use/expectation is at least a year (or two) old. I like the Z30 phone. It reminds me of the glorious BB days for all the right reasons. The keyboard is especially good. Other commenters have bragged about the keyboard, and I now know why. Camera... nah.. just so so!The BB Blend is a really useful feature. and I am loving it because once you are in the office and connected to the desktop, you don\\'t need your phone except to make/receive calls. The push technology is good; I seemed to get notifications before it shows up in my email inbox. The call quality is good, too!My reason for 3 stars -- the Apps ecosystem is woefully inadequate, even with the Amazon Appstore for some reason. I have not had the time to check it all out... and this phone has the latest OS. On top of that, I learned WhatsApp will not support and will discontinue for this OS after Dec. 31. So buyer beware! Not able to install my Vonage Extensions App, either!At this point, I am disappointed for that reason, as I will be having a very expensive equipment that will be less and less worth. I used to be a big fan of BB, and I still love this z30 phone for all it does, but unfortunately there is a lot it does not, compared to all the other phones that are out there. Therein lies the rub! For just phone and email use -- if this is all one needs to use -- this IS a good product!I don\\'t know if I can return it back for a refund...because as much as I would like not to, unfortunately I don\\'t see myself using this phone for long for all the things it is lacking... It\\'s a good phone that runs smoothly. The cameras stand up pretty well even after almost a year after it was bought, you just have to zoom in rather than getting close to very small objects. The screen has NO cracks or scratches unlike many top brands and the two year warranty is very comforting. The earbuds have not broken or been distorted in any way, which was one of the main reasons I got this over others in the price range. It is very easy to use and customizable like most Androids, but this is completely off contract and can be easily used on prepaid. because twice i got a phone with a burn thru on the screen ,from the same company& it still has some other problems. Phone arrived and appeared new and in a Sprint iphone box. However, when brought to the Sprint store to activate they advised that it was not a Sprint phone and they would be unable to activate it for service. What is the pin number for the phone? The Security pin? I need this.. Thank you. It is a simple quad band, good for use overseas. I use a CDMA here in the US so I buy this when I travel overseas. The phone came in a sealed apple box and really does look like new. The only thing which was odd, was that when I checked for Apple warranty online they told me that the warranty was expired and the phone was produced more than 2 years ago. Customer service guaranteed me that still the phone was new and not refurbished and I was sticking with that, as really everything else seemed like new.Another small thing which is odd: this phone has Chinese preinstalled as language in all apps and many sub menus. Although changing the primary language to English it was not possible to remove Chinese completely as a language. I tried to get around that by installing Spanish as a second language so Chinese is now only third. Nevertheless Chinese signs keep popping up from time to time on the phone. I keep waiting for the article Good Great phone and great value, my son loves it. Working excelent on Argentina carriers, the phone is a little heavy but it is worth it. Love it were it all the time. This would turn out to be my third phone in the past 4 months... My first phone was an Alcatel One Touch Fierce... Then I upgraded to the Blu life pure and I\\'ll admit that was a great phone... But the phone fell into the ocean while at the beach...So I got this phone... This is the best phone I have ever had.PROS:Both cameras work well in all lightingScreen is very clearPhone speed is very fast on both WI-FI and cellular dataI bought a 16GB SD card and our works fine with the phone despite others saying that android 4.4 has SD card problemsEverything else is greatCONSSim and SD card can only be put in one the battery is taken outOnce the battery is taken out and put it back in, then you have to log in to all apps( Facebook, twitter etc..)It gets hot really fastSo all in all, this phone has the greatest value. It has a way better value as compared to the moto g The phone was fine except that within a week of having the phone it began to have problems charging...I bought several charges thinking that was the problem. It however was not the issue, it was the phone itself. I do not reccomend the item due to the fact that it was defective. So far so good phone is working, granddaughter very happy. Watch is hard to hear phone call and is horrible This phone is absolutely amazing & this is the first iPhone I\\'ve ever had :). The battery is better than Android because I only need to charge it every 2 days instead of everyday. It\\'s very well designed & I\\'ll stick with Apple for a very long time haha. Hasn\\'t been 6 months and it already cutting on and off by it self and the battery shows critical battery and when charging it shows its charging only to be dead when taken off. I love this bt watch, I\\'ve had it a month and it has held up well. The software is easy to use, it may not be as nice as its more expensive counterparts but it works just fine and is a good way to see if having a bt watch is something you would like to invest money in down the road. Just don\\'t get it wet, although it\\'s a watch it\\'s still technically a cell phone. Everything Ok. Excelent Product So far so good. We are with Verizon but do not want to pay for device payments and have always purchased Samsung phones used or refurbished from a store here. With Samsung the way it\\'s been the last year, we decided to move away from them for awhile. This Motorola G•4 plus is great so far. It\\'s not my old Note but it does everything I need it to do so far. I will miss my hancom office program however. For $260 it was a steal! Screen is bright and responsive. Speakers are greatl. Even my husband can hear me better on speaker phone with this new phone. The camera is also great. I was able to pop my sim right in from Verizon and I was up an running! I love not being stuck with a carrier until device payments are done. I pair my phone with a Poetic slim clear case that I love. Paid for priority shipping and got it even sooner than expected! Great phone, great seller.. completely satisfied w/my purchase! Thx! :) I purchased this phone as a replacement for a broken touch screen phone. I was afraid the buttons being so small would present a problem because I have large hands but I have a no trouble texting or dialing out. This phone does everything I need it to do. they sold me a used article when he was allegedly new. The detached display and the serial number of the fuzzy cover. Good.. After 6 months usage my device got an update that got it bricked and stuck in a boot loop, I contacted HTC to find out this device was user unlocked illegally not factory unlocked as stated in the product title! Why I called them? My device was bricked due to wrong software updates assignment due to mismatch between location and updates. My device was updated with an ineligible software making it seem like the device had been rooted with a corrupt software! The device was initially locked to an Australian carrier called Optus. The device is beyond repair and I\\'m reporting this to amazon for fraud. it works EXCELENTE This cellphone is a piece of sh.. after 3 months started to cause problem and is no longer available for returns... The screen is freeze and I can not do anything to solve the problem It reached all my expectations. Battery is enough for one day at heavy use, which is not much, but acceptable. Been using it for almsot 2 days and haven\\'t encountered any issues. It was kinda difficult to get my phone to connect because you have to install an app and some software but it\\'s sorted out with the booklet. Great phone for a great price! Does everything I need it to and easy to use. Works well with Straight Talk Wireless service.A couple of things that weren\\'t clear to me from reading the product description: The phone requires a STANDARD SIM card and the charger cord is not compatible with U.S. outlets. Let me just say that this buy was absolutely amazing! It arrived when it said, the phone is beautiful, and brand new! I\\'m more than happy with this purchase. I love this phone. The first smartphones I ever got was a blackberry. My second one was also a blackberry. Then I got an iPhone and now the Priv. This is a gorgeous looking phone. The camera is topnotch. For some I had really missed the physical keyboard. The performance is great. This beats iPhone and Samsung. The only problem ifyou call it that is the battery life.Blackberry definitely made the right choice in switching to android and I hope blackberry more great phones like the Priv. Blackberry has the edge over the other phones: privacy. That\\'s really important for work purposes. I needed a basic phone for my elderly father and this worked out perfectly. He did not want any of the modern \"smart phones\" but rather a simple and basic phone. The ruggedness and built in flash light are plus as well. The call quality is clear and the ringers are quite loud. The only reason I did not rate it five stars is because of the size. It is somewhat too small for the palm of a grown man. My phone was dead out of the box. It wouldn\\'t take a charge. Never would power on. Quality control for this product must be very lacking. When you pay this amount of money for a phone you expect great quality. The price paid is worth it, is a pocket pc, lighter than the earlier and much faster, fine by samsung this time. it\\'s so simple but so much necessary features like flashlight, radio and analog TV. perfect for the less digital places. I received this phone in excellent condition. I ordered. This for my daughter and she is very pleased amd excited. Good phone for the price I got this phone after many years of using the IPhone, so I am not used to Android. Needless to say, I have to give myself time, but I am wishing I had my iphone. The feel and coloring is perfect. Just a little slow and dificult for me to work it properly. Going to give my self time though. I ordered this a few weeks ago and was really excited about receiving it. Coincidentally the day before my N95-4 arrived, Nokia released a new firmware update so the first thing I did was update the software on my N95-4 to the latest version.During the update process I noticed the USB port on the phone itself seemed loose but thought nothing of it. After the update was done I began to use the phone and I ended up returning it to Amazon the next day! You\\'ve seen all the positive reviews, so I won\\'t rehash that, but here are why I returned it:- The USB port on my N95-4 was extremely loose or broken. You had to apply a lot of pressure and push the cable in and then not touch it for it to stay connected. It was so loose that a breeze from the window could disconnect the device from the PC. I tried several USB cables, computers/ports with no success.- The USB transfer speed is HORRIFIC for a device that comes with 8GB. It took almost 2.5 hours to transfer about 4GB of music to the device using Windows Media Player. Using mass storage mode is just as slow since this uses USB 2.0 Full-Speed (old spec) not USB 2.0 High-Speed (common today). No matter what people tell you this is absolutely frustrating and annoying over time, even if you don\\'t transfer stuff much.- The slider on the phone is wobbly and whenever I pressed a button on the keypad it made a creaking sound that I don\\'t expect from a $600 phone. It did not feel solid at all, at least not my N95-4- The overall size of the device is surprisingly small but the thing is as thick as a brick which makes it awkward to carry in your pant pocket or worse jeans pocket.- Even without really installing any apps on it the thing would randomly slow down and not respond to key presses and then just \"wake up\" all of a sudden it was bizarre.- Does not charge via USB. Not used to this so was annoying that you have to at times have both a USB cable and Nokia charger plugged in.I ended up getting a Nokia N78 (US 3G) that was just recently released and I\\'m extremely happy with it. It addresses most if not all of the issues I had with the N95-4 including fastest USB, fast CPU/responsive, excellent build quality.I would recommend looking at the N78 or the upcoming N96 (successor to N95) over the N95-4. Samsung is the absolute best. This phone is amazing. Great phone The purchase of my phone was excellent just had a little problem when the goods arrive at the miami dierccion empty box came quick fix but everything you gave me really answer immediately all his service is very good thank you very much This phone is great. I\\'ve never rated a product before but I feel like I had to for this product. I\\'ve seen people posted all sort of negative reviews about this phone including but not limited to too little instructions. Are you kidding me? If you don\\'t know have to use an android phone, don\\'t buy an android phone. This phone operates the same way as any other android phone, for the most part. The only thing I would mention is I wish it has a light to indicate miss calls/texts and charging in progress. The Button at the bottom has to be pressed very hard to get the phone to work. I called the company and they said I would have to send the phone back. I did not have a back up phone so they said the only other thing they could do is refund me $35 out of the $289.00. I took it because I thought maybe it would pay to get it fixed but when I asked how much it would be to get it fixed they said starting at $64. This is a great, inexpensive phone. Other reviewers complain of things that are missing, and I\\'ll agree that a flash for the camera, a rear facing camera, and a larger internal SD card would be great. However, for the money I can\\'t see beating this (date: July 2014). I like this phone, I was skeptical because of reviews saying it couldn\\'t be connected to Straight talk, but I live in California and had no trouble at all, got my same number and everything. I just had to pay $6.99 to get the network access code and that was it! I do see the battery goes kinda fast and sometimes the phone doesn\\'t seem to like the charger(sometimes its goes on and off charge, but it does charge), but other than that it\\'s great! I bought this refurbished phone because mine was old and wouldn\\'t hold a charge for more than a 4-5 hours and I didn\\'t want to spend a ridiculous amount of money on a brand new phone. I was skeptical after reading some reviews, but the refurbished phone works great! No visible damages, either. The only problem is that it didn\\'t come with a sim card. I called my carrier to have one shipped, but they needed some number that was not included with the phone so I had to go into the local store to have a sim card installed. Very good cell phone. I recommend it Love it , no problem works amazing ! Works great good camera runs smoothly and works with my carrier perfectly even this T-Mobile sucks in general It says \"LTE\". But it doesn\\'t work in Argentina, with argentinian carriers. You can see more information at: http://www.willmyphonework.net/ The shipment time take too long. When I receive the product, the product is defected. Sometimes it works and sometime is not. Supplier feedback is good. They try to fix problem or refuned to me. I change the setting and it is not stable. What you can said. It is only watch. Not really good for cell phone. I would give supplier positive review, but the product itself is not as good as you thought.GSM Quadband Voice Dialing Watch Cell Phone Unlocked Friends in West Africa love it!! Its fast and takes great pictures... So far it all works great... My husband likes the phone!! More features n the touch The camera capability is ugh! I am very satisfied with my phone. It came in brand new condition. Works great too! I had to use my old phone\\'s charger though, because the charger that came with the phone doesn\\'t work properly. Works well this review is for the tablet that goes in this wonderful case. The Samsung galaxy note 10.1 is a great tablet if you get one with a good power supply. Search the net and you will see that numerous people had this problem. and I have to pay for repairs on my tablet because Samsung doent\\' want to admit the tablet is flawed. I had this case on the device from the day I bought it and there IS NO WAY it became damaged.So, CASE GOOD.. tablet that its made for is not.. I suggest you take pictures of the tablet, make sure you get pics of the power button and maybe do a little movie to show there is no problem before you put the tab. in the case. also, put your sd card in the device before you put on the case..mI started calling about the power problem 3 weeks after I bought it. Bear in mind, I put an Otter Box on the tablet the day I got the tablet.Samsung told me that it was a simple fix just press the power button and vol. at the same time and it would fix the problem. Well. I called from December to April was told over and over it just needed to be reset. It finally started powering off and on at exactly 5sec on and 5sec off. This seems to note an internal problem. I still sent it in. And now I\\'m told i BROKE the power button and i needed to send $150 to repair it.I explained that I had the tablet look at by a friend who teaches computer. And he looked it over and said, i would have to send it in as there were no outward signs of a problem.This tablet has POWER problems that will only be fixed if you send it in. so, if you don\\'t mind rolling the dice with a product that is documented with known faults that Samsung will not admit to.. then enjoy your limited time with the tablet. good, every thing very good.Es lo que esperaba,tambien fue enviado en el lapso prometido.Considero que es una buena opcioon para comprar Great phone. Worked properly in Argentina, with 4G LTE connection. I bought this for my husband because he doesn\\'t like or want a smartphone. He had an older version of this phone, many years old, and it lasted forever until the battery finally gave out. For about $50 more I was able to get him this new one. It is a great little phone, very slim and light, and the camera and standard features work great. Would recommend for someone who just wants a phone for making and receiving calls, simple texts, and a few pictures here and there. i like the phone by to ways, its good screen size and the conectivity, runs perfect in venezuela digitel. and big screen allows easy book readings with pdf viewers. my only complaint is 2 things. its extrange native launcher and stubborn die hard apps that always meddle and (may be because of the last) the battery doesnt last good. also delivery experience was terrible but not because of the seller. we have many handiccaps to buy in venezuela. its almost impossible to buy from amazon as of lately.in all other aspects this phone is very good. can be customized. uses fm radio withput data usage. easy memory on browser tabs, easy handling for reading books, good screen size. good wow factor. good fabric and materialsi also bought a 16 gb sd card for memory expand uses so the 4 internal gb space disk is no issuety for reading Not fully compatible with T-Mobile in the USA I guess I thought I was buying a brand new phone so when my husband said the ear piece wasn\\'t working I was takenback. it was a fake samnsung!!!!i was deceived by the seller!!! This item was exactly what I expected and works just fine Very pleased with my purchase. It arrived on time and just as it was advertised. 🔥 not good The screen not big enough and can barely hear The phone display stopped working in 6 months and I cannot use the phone. it is an excellent smart phone with the such price. in good condition, good quality and excellent performance Great phone until I dropped it. Fast, clean, decent price. No bloatware, unless you count some of the moto stuff like the hand motions and the moto version of Siri. Both of which I found useful, especially the shake for flashlight. Excellent would buy this again i love this phone, it\\'s very functional and modern, it got a lot of stuff; but what i love best is that when you are playing music without headsets it sounds pretty good and loud so thats cool. great purchase as always nokia is the best. My only gripe: the 928\\'s beautiful, wide screen can crack easily if it falls on one of its corners. Otherwise, this is an impressive phone, with an exceptional camera. Windows 8 takes some getting used to, but it\\'s actually quite refreshing after having used Apple. I\\'ve never used Android. The app store isn\\'t the biggest, but it has most of the best known applications out there. Some of Nokia\\'s apps are exceptional too, including the filters for photos. The GPS, HERE Drive, is functional, but drains the battery fast. Use your charger while operating. The phone is elegant too. A well-designed, pocket computer. And it\\'s free from Verizon with a contract. Excellent phone, best relationship price benefit Simply the best Good excelente The operating system sucks!!!! Not very user friendly..I was not pleased..and would have loved to get my money back ! Perfect Not pleased as I\\'m unable to get anything saved to the SD Card, not sure if it\\'s the brand NEW card or the phone itself causing this issue. Bought it for my 8 yr old daughter and I\\'m disappointed to see it not work as it should giving it being her first smartphone. A bit on the small side and battery dies fairly quickly I believe this is a good phone for a person who is not a heavy phone user such as myself. I have noticed there is a little lag with the auto rotation in text, but that is not a big deal. I really enjoy the resolution, good amount of pixels over a 3.7\\'\\' screen equals crisp and beautiful screen. I am a little concerned however that the memory may not be the greatest due to all the bloatware. They are putting the same amount of bloatware on this thing as they do on the Samsung Galaxy S2!! I think I might freeze the apps if I have the guts to possibly put the device in risk....Overall brilliant phone, it is good-looking and I hope that it is durable. I would not say the build was the best...seems very plastic-based. good Excelent Cellphone Loved my Galaxy! Some items can only be displayed in chinese. These include sim card number in notificationsHave issues with data. It starts as 4g but then drops data connection despite displaying 3g.Have tested many times and its not a coverage problem.When restarted data sometimes works again.Switching back to my s6 duos If you going abroad, good choice. And Even with the possibility fot 2 simcards. Just got it. It works with a Norwegian simcard. Just tried it. camera,,,, really crisp pictures, they are saved by day, nice featuresending pictures, to send a picture all you need to do is check the pictures you are sending, text or email.. so simple..easy to set up pages, and move icons.plenty of customizable features.problems, if you move and icon onto home page\\'s, it is saved and uses more space..has too many apps pre downloadedconstantly updating the predown loaded apps,, annoying ..Still have not been able to customize rings for each person in address book.Bigest Problem Ring tones selection, bites.. I like an old phone ring,,they only have science fiction type ringsand songs dont play loud enough to get my attention. Over all;; compared to my last phone, HTC ONE,, the camera is Great, the phone hasnt slipped out of my hand and droppedso far I am very happy with the phone. just too many pre loads on it taking up space and updating all of the time drains the battery as well. One day i will get around to deleting em.. i love the phone so much Great phone. I like it better than the crappy motorola phone I was using. Switched the phone over quite easily. Good Phone for a teenager who continually drops and mistreats his device. Texting is not easy, but I prefer to speak with him rather than text. Very Good! THIS PURCHASE WAS TO REPLACE MY OLD TWIST PHONE THAT BROKE I REALLY LIKE THIS PHONE AND IT WORKS FINE VERY HAPPY.VERIZON CANNOT FIND THIS PHONE NOR CAN ASURION WANTED TO GIVE ME SOME OFF BRAND P.O.S. FOUND MY OWN THANX GUYS. Very nice phone. Had some problems when it arrived. Everything was in spanish. Once got language straightened out. and got the correct size simm card, Works great. Love it. Only 200 and this phone is just as good as any. Just got it a few days ago and I can\\'t believe how great it is. I used to have Samsung s4 and this is 80% better. Better camera and even faster speed of service. My messages used to take 1 2 min to send and receive. This phone does it within 2 seconds. Such a huge change but I am so happy with getting this. It could not have been better. get this phone ! I highly recommend it. Its also big !:) I did buy two phones, one arrived with no bone damage was irreparable served I\\'ve been using this phone for about a month and it\\'s working great for a refurbished iPhone 5c! There is a small, minor scratch on the screen that isn\\'t noticeable when the screen is on, and a small portion of the apple logo is scratched off of the back. But I can\\'t complain because they do warn that there will be minor damage on the exterior of the phone. It came with the charger. I wanted there to be headphones too, but that\\'s just wishful thinking. So Far So Good I had it about a month now and it works great!! With no problems! Camera leaves a lot to be desired. Will be fine if your not planing on trying to produce award winning photos. Otherwise, quite worth the money if your looking for a nice smartphone and don\\'t want to pay upward of $700.00! Will not work on T mobiles 4g LTE Is a great phone. Besides, the camera is great. Is really fast and easy to use. One thing that is not so great is the size and weight. Is a little bigger and heavy than I am use to. The rest is great. Dislike it didn\\'t work :-( Phone works. No functionality problems. The problem is the content. The guy im assuming it was a guy who owned this phone before I did, had an interesting still frame still on the movie player app even though the file was deleted, porn. Sanitized the phone, im not squeamish. Don\\'t think im going to get a used modern smart phone again. Excelente Power button can be a bit wiggly but this is a good windows phone. No 8.1 update or Cortana, but this phone is a good buy. excellent product Bad conditions. Reviewing the item I discover that part of the main board is broken, specifically on the SIM card pins. Did not send the Smart Tags mentioned on the description of the Item. Phones battery dies really fast and doesn\\'t work very good. Not very pleased with this purchase. muy bueno Good phone I\\'ve had this phone for 5 Months now and still Love this phone. Like how it comes with case and screen cover. Like the USB port on the top of the phone, good for laying in bed and using phone while its charging. Camera is better than most at 13Mp. Seriously the brightest torch/flashlight I\\'ve ever seen on a phone; compared with friends\\' iPhone 5, Xperia Z1 and Galaxy S5; this phone would be necessary if lost in dark woods. Has many small features that no other phones have; scrolling text on lock display, options to add widgets that still work on lock display. I would highly recommend this to people, just not close friends (I don\\'t want them to have such a nice phone as me!) Keep it up #Bluproducts It is durable, waterproof, and great if you just want a basic phone for calling and texting. The only cons about this phone is that it is bulky but I can deal with. Inntime all perfect Great phone for the first few weeks. The screen on mine \"bleed\" until the whole screen was black. Great dealFound it open box for $350 USHonestly best phone with dual front facing speakers on the marketAlcatel needs to get on the the high end Snapdragons to compete Exactly what I was expecting. Arrived quickly. Thank you I wanted a cheap fitness tracker with clock.The Bad: The pedometer said unavailable, the sleep tracker said unavailable, and I could only find the sedentary alert once- don\\'t know if that worked.The Middle: The band on it is huge. I\\'m a big girl that usually uses extra links in a watch, and I was on the second to last hole here. It\\'s thicker and heavier than I expected, but I think I would get used to it.The Good: Even though I didn\\'t want to connect it to my phone, it connected easily to my iPhone 6. I could get my music, even though it wasn\\'t very loud. I liked the idea of an FM radio. Even though the headphones didn\\'t fit, good sound quality. Love it best blu phone yet!!! Purchased for Spouse,He loves it. Wife really likes it. I love it My Cricket siM card works What a lot of people don\\'t seem to take into consideration is that this company is somewhat new with phones and there are going to be \"some\" that come off the assembly line with issue. EVERY company has this issue yet most people don\\'t see the Samsung/Apple issues as much.Don\\'t be swayed into thinking this is a bad phone, in general, because someone (here and there) gets a bad one. That\\'s why Amazon has a replacement policy that non-lazy people make great use of rather than whine and complaining about getting a bad phone and doing nothing.These phones are VERY light and pretty thin so they WILL break (EASILY) when you drop them on hard surfaces. To \"prevent\" this, order a \"tempered\" protection screen and an anti \"shock\" case with the phone (total of $20 investment) and you\\'re well covered.I, personally, use Straight Talk AT&T on mine and it works GREAT. With phone coverage there\\'s no getting it and it\\'s great everywhere. Some places, like stores, tend to kill signals and it\\'s normal.My business is under large power lines and i still get a really good signal, which is abnormal for cell phones here. The data/sms may need a little tweaking on the settings but to, again, non-lazy individuals...it\\'s 15-20 mins of research to find it on Google.As far as camera goes, the back is great and the front is a bit granular but, again, this is expected. Know about \"megapixels\" before you but a phone and say, \"This isn\\'t what i expected\". The front camera is 2MP, that\\'s a decade old technology. It\\'s NOT supposed to be super-crisp and sharp. However, better lighting does improve it. The darker things get on cameras, the worse the photo can look. For Skype, it will suffice.The GPS on this phone is actually good and when i say good i mean, when you\\'re sitting still AND when Google Maps is tracking you going down the road. Now, with GPS, if you\\'re in a heavily wooded area (with lots of trees close to the road) you can lose signal no matter how good your GPS is supposed to be.The sound is really great in a normal, not overly loud situation. I\\'ve sit and listened to music both by speaker and bluetooth and it\\'s worked great. If you get outside (with a lot going on around you), get close to traffic, or drive with a window open...of course the quality is going to drop down. Even inside, with fans and old air-conditions, the sound quality can diminish because you have to be \"realistic\". These are TINY speakers. What would you expect from them...rock concert quality? No. If you don\\'t like the sound, get a bluetooth, stand alone, speaker with a bigger speaker built-in for better sound.I hear a lot of people complain about, \"I can\\'t hear the ringtone\" with cell phone. Okay, some \"reality\" here. When you\\'re \"out\" and the cell phone is in your pocket or you\\'re in and you\\'re in a loud situation (even if you don\\'t see it as loud) you won\\'t hear it. MY advice, to remedy this issue, is get a \"smart\" watch that connects with it and vibrates (and gives info) about who\\'s calling. I do this because i don\\'t like missing calls and the smart watch has saved me on a lot of this. The vibration allows me to know someone is calling without disturbing my situation if I\\'m dealing with clients.The Bluetooth, i\\'ve used a headset (Kinivo, stereo i love it, sold here) and walked as far as 35 yards away from the phone in the open and 20-25 yards when the phone was inside a building and there was a lot of electronics running. Bluetooth signal strength depends as MUCH on the headset as it does on the phone, this is not a one-way situation. You can have a phone with the best Bluetooth on the planet and you get a headset with a weak signal and you\\'re still going to get poor response. It takes getting good on both sides.The Wifi and Data are the same. A router, that emits good signal will work great with this phone even up to a distance of 20-30 yards away as long as it\\'s a good router and there is little in-between to block the signal. The data all depends on the towers and, like GPS, can be poor is heavily wooded areas, especially if you are down in a valley and the tower is on the other side of a mountain.I am, normally, a Samsung person but i bought this phone as a backup and it\\'s been worth the money. I even ordered one for my head of security, which has a side job where she does physical labor. She followed my advice about protecting the phone and just raves about how \"well\" it works. And when something i order her doesn\\'t work...believe me...I HEAR about it. LOL.Sound Loudness/Quality - 4.5 out of 5Bluetooth response and distance - 4 out of 5Camera Front/Back - 3.75 out of 5GPS Speed/Accuracy - 4.5 out of 5WIFI / Data - 4 out of 5 The service has been great, unfortunately my phone was defective, but my contact (David) has been working with all the way.He is working to make it all good. Does not work for Verizon wireless, waste of money. Excellent recommend. Excelent Yes ,it came on time and was very useful Great phone! Love it! Very disappointed.... Had this phone only 6 days and now it wont charge....just sent it back...i don\\'t recommend it Horrible wouldn\\'t work couldn\\'t text call receive calls i love it Love my mini smartphone! I find the Nokia x3-02 easy to work with the basic features. The phone is rather small with small screen, great for basic needs to include the usage of media features like the web and radio, sending photos. I would not recommended for folks that are looking for fancy features and have lots of experience with cell phones. All was excelent good Had this phone for about two weeks now and I love it. First of all, the color green is so beautiful and bright. I ,Love the screen resolution, to me its better than a Samsung s4. The camera is ok but to me when you take the pictures with Instagram it comes out much better. If you are thinking of buying this do so you wouldn\\'t be disappointed..... Has no NFC ---who builds a phone without NFC today at this price point The phone was supposed to be new but it clearly wasn\\'t. The battery is shot and drains itself completely in about an hour. And when I plugged it into the computer there was already someone\\'s name associated with it. Phone Calls Hands-free is awesome! no longer works for sprint, seller took it back but he wasn\\'t thrilled about it. i wish they still made phones like that. its what i wanted perfect! The phone arrived right on time. It was in great shape and worked great. I\\'m very satisfied with my phone. Moto G4 Plus. What a Great $300 phone. It replaces a Nexus 6P 128g that died after nougat upgrade. No NFC but everything else is great. Great and accurate finger print scanner (actually prefer it on the front), good pictures, good sound, beautiful screen, perfect size at 5.5\", stock Android, solid build, great battery life that lasts all day with turbo charging! I wish this phone was out before I spent $700 on a 6p. The seller TechnoMaster contacted me and told me that the telephone is really unlocked worldwide, they had their provider and Samsung unlock the phones before importing them to the US. So only the sticker in Italian is wrong, it should have been removed. I am changing from 3 to 5 stars my rating of TechnoMaster.This is the original review I wrote, before being contacted by TechnoMaster:The phone was bought in the US, but I received a model for Europe, with instructions in Italian(!) saying that the phone is for Europe and in order to avoid region locking, the phone has to be activated in Europe with an European SIM card m(and make a 5 minute call with the European SIM card. If you don\\'t read Italian and activate the phone in the Americas, the phone will be locked (while you bought an unlocked phone!).Even if the phone says \"International version\", that doesn\\'t mean that a customer has to know about the unfortunate region locking \"feature\" by Samsung and that the phone bought in the US has to be activated in Europe. It is not honest from Samsung (and the vendor in the US) to not specify exactly these restrictions in the specs of the phone, and not tell you when buying that the phone has to be used first in Europe. Nice phone, feels solidly built and feels nice. For a phone of this price you cannot go wrong for a daily user. However, if your more of a phone enthusiast this would most likely not be the phone for you. I had recently lost my old iPhone 5c and was in desperate need for a new phone. I just recieved a used iphone 5c 32gb from Dutchmoney10. Although it did come in ahead of time i am not happy with the condition and further problems that came with this iPhone. The seller neglected to notify that the phone did not come with an \"active\" sim card which was told to me while i was attempting to set up the new phone through at&t at my house. Now i will have to pay an extra 36 dollars to purchase and activate the new sim card. I don\\'t understand why they would deactivate the previous sim card so that it is completely useless and basically trash and then proceed to not notify me and to make it my problem to dispose of. The product description listed that the phone had a few minor blemishes and scratches on the back but come to find out all four corners are chipped and the back side is is torn up like it was thrown across pavement. also the on/off button is loose and is difficult to press. I am not happy with this seller and the only reason that i will keep this phone is because i am in such dear need for a phone. I will never buy a used phone again and especially not from Dutchmoney10 and i suggest you don\\'t either its deffinitely worth it to splurge a little for something with better quality. Very limited compatibility. Even took it to the \"Geek Squad\" (which was more than I should have to do) and they could not sync it. Do not recommend. muy bueno Its good i love everything about this phone except the battery doesnt last that much long. i have a lot of apps and i know that runs down the battery faster than normal but generally, the phone is great. i highly recommend it to anyone who wants something affordable and quality. The Bluetooth did not work properly after many tries. I returned it. Disappointing from Samsung with this expensive phone!!!! Not worth a review for the waste of my time I Love I love this set. Product arrived on time. The phone looks nice. Zena guys are good with their service too. Best mobile if you are looking for touch and type. totally works fine! I don\\'t know how to get rid of the spam splash screens (it pops up as verizon and there are all these junk applications) BUT it seems ot work perfectly fine with straight talk, so I do appreciate that. It\\'s super easy to install, just follow the instructions and look forward to cell phone savings!!!! A very nice phone but I am disappointed with the memory. Good This phone is awesome, it does everything!! I bought it for my brother and he was more than happy. You can play tons of games football, Mario, tennis, surf the web wherever you are, google maps, radio, even the ringtones are fun! Worth the price. Works well Good It has a very good relation, price/performance. The phone did not work! Do not buy from this person. excelent Nope. Received on time. My daughter loves her replacement phone.only complaint is that the battery goes down fast, not a big deal she turns it off at school. Good looking product.Fast transport very good It\\'s ok but it freezes up from time to time. excellent product nive but have not chance to change languaje, still nice phone, perfect for pictures and internet, we recomended HTC phone good My iPhone that I ordered from Amazon worked great. I had no issues with turning it on or getting it activated. Came unscathed with charging equipment. I am highly satisfied and love my phone! Update: the issue was solved. The sim card was the problem not the phone.i bought this phone to my wife, she is so happy with it. the only thing that could be a complaint is that in my country lte does not work with it.telephone carrier Claro Ecuador I chose this rating because the phone isn\\'t working good, whenever i\\'m on the phone i can barely hear and also the phone came with the menu in spanish language meanwhile i\\'m not spanish. I\\'m not recommending this product to no one Excellent phone. Good for dowload, watching and keep videos. Good internet connection and easy to use it. I love it! exelente I love the phone just got it yesterday but one thing it would have been so nice if the apps were assemble like Samsung apps . Horrible phone didn\\'t last more then 3 months, very slow then all of a sudden it would not turn on. Package showed up on time and the phone worked great and still does except the battery doesn\\'t stay charged too long but I have not seen one of these phones that do. Can\\'t complain about the price either. JUST A GREAT PHONE- IM SO HAPPY AND SO IS MY PRINCESS Great phone Bought this for a friend was great she loves it I\\'ve never seen her so excited. Excellent! Thanks! This was one of the most iconic and sought-after smartphones in the early 21st century. The Sidekick was an exclusive for T-mobile and was so cool that it made you want to switch your carrier just to experience its coolness. However, now the software is defunct and no longer supported as stated by Microsoft. I would suggest maybe purchasing this for someone who\\'s in desperate need for a phone, but that can deal without cool features such as watching videos on YouTube, video chatting, or popular apps, as the phone could never do that when it initially released. The phone is quite gorgeous regardless and it still looks pretty rad considering its age. It has a nice and spacious QWERTY keyboard that makes texting and possibly emailing a sinch! It also has a trackball (that lights up to your liking) and trackpad for easy navigation. The phone makes amazing sound effects as you scroll across the home and when you press the back button and whatnot. It\\'s quite outdated, but this phone still has appeal despite it\\'s lack of features that every phone today has. Everything in Low cost. Nice look. Works great.This is Samsung\\'s Hidden Gem. I can say this is the perfect phone for low cost. Its Great!!! This is slightly different than the S7, negatives are no built in compass so it can\\'t sense which way your headed unless the GPS is on and you\\'re moving, no light meter so it has to use the camera, so automatic screen brightening and dimming is non-existent. On the plus side, I believe the screen is slightly bigger than the S7, it has a built in FM radio and the headphone jack is on the bottom. Think about it, you look at your phone, then put it in your pocket upside down, so a bottom jack makes all kinds of sense.I haven\\'t done many pics yet with the camera, but it is inferior to the camera in the Note 4 which was so awesome it made me forget I wanted a \"real\" camera.If you drive for Uber and Lyft, this has no issues running both apps and GPS at the same time. Just make sure you have a phone charger that can stay on top of the power draw. Using a USB cable and the USB jack in my Sonata, the battery slowly lost level.I mounted mine using a magnetic mount AC clip so it\\'s being cooled all day as I drive and there are no overheating issues from running GPS, both apps and Pandora. Because there is no light meter, I must occasionally refresh the screen brightness on my own as i have yet to find an app that automatically polls the camera every minute or two to refresh screen brightness. At just over $200 (USD), this was well worth the money! Amazing, very easy to use and even with its small size the keyboard is very responsive. I love it! This phone is awesome! As far as I can tell it works just fine. I had ordered one before just like it, but sent it back because some of the letters on the keyboard didn\\'t respond when you pushed them. Return was super easy, and now I have this one, and I love it! I was trying to be price conscious but it ended up costing me more money in the end. The screen felt cheap and when it did a system upgrade it stopped working on my network. I could not get the phone to recognize my sim card. I am very tech savy and nothing worked. The screen doesn\\'t respond very well to my touch not even a stylus helps. It took me abnormally long to send a text: between the phone guessing the opposite of what I was trying to text and or the horrible lagging it was unbearable. If you don\\'t text much or are a slow texter this phone would work for you but It drove me crazy. I purchased a 5.5 Blu phone and I LOVE it. Blu does make great phone just not this one. Finally a phone that works It doesn\\'t have the choice to change the lenguages. Only Works in english, chinese Everything as expected A little bit dirty box and a european charger but all the rest is ok No good idea get it this cell phone the touch screan glass is broke very dissatisfied not recommend to buying. Use phone. Amazing product condition. excelent Wow! This phone is amazing for the price paid. Easy to use with many amazing features. very goob I am kind of not sure about the product. I received a charger (the plug I mean) which is not US compatible?? Looking forward for an answer from the seller. i thought it was decent until I sneezed with the phone in my hand and now I have a crack across the middle of the screen This phone is worth every penny. The new Galaxy S5 costs more than I was willing to pay for a phone so I opted on the S4 with the manufacture\\'s warranty. It is very easy to set up and operate, in fact this is an excellent phone for dummies like me who are new to this technology. I would recommend this phone to anyone, but be sure to purchase an Otter case to protect your investment! I LIKE! My first impressions for this phone is pretty good. I\\'m happy to see the amount of flagship phone qualities that this packs for under $300. I previously had the Samsung Galaxy S4 and I’m happy with the switch so far. I’m loving the 5.5 inch screen for browsing the web or watching videos although it’s going to take some time for me to adjust to the size of the phone. The dual facing front speakers are great, it’s much louder and clearer than the S4’s speaker. The near stock Android user interface was nice and smooth with some lag when opening up new applications. However, there are some problems that keeps this phone away from getting a 5 star rating. The power button is placed too high to operate without adjusting your hands and I thought that the double tap to power feature would help alleviate this problem but it doesn’t work most of the time when the screen is off. One more problem is the video recording quality looks low quality, during playback it’s like watching 360p or 480p videos that is scaled up to 1080p. These problems can probably be fixed with new updates, but until then I’ll leave the rating at a 4 star for now. Here are some other pros and cons.Pros:- Bright and clear display- Great dual front facing speakers- Pretty smooth user interface- Good reception (I had no issues connecting this phone with the AT&T network)- Camera takes decent pictures for the price- Slim body- Reversible screen and call featureCons:- Power button placement- Double tap power feature is unreliable at times (subject to change)- Poor quality 1080p video recording (subject to change)- Some lag when opening application- Lack of IR blaster- Non user replaceable battery- Radio feature gets terrible receptionOther note:- The phone call sound effect volume gradually gets lower when you call someone. I don’t know if this is intentional or a defective speaker. However, when the person answers their phone the volume seemed fine throughout the call. Great phone. Happy with my purchase. Camera is great and lots of customization options. too much hurt on the bottom, very upset. Perfect phone for my son. He had an iphone 5 but it was acting up. He needed a new phone but the iphone 7 is too expensive. He mainly uses the phone for texting and downloading games. We figured it\\'s a great deal. And it is. He loves it. The phone will not stay on. It continues to reboot itself. When I contacted the seller they were not helpful. I an currently doing a A-Z claim to try and resolve this matter. The Samsung Mini only work for one week it was good for one week then it just died won\\'t turn on wont charge I got a refund from Amazon because the seller wasn\\'t any help at all Great phone. I always loved HTC phones and this one didnt disappoint. The speed, it doesnt get hot, superb camera with wonderful manual settings, and a strong build. Only thing is that the G4 has a better camera...... But thats ok. we really liked the phone that we received As good as the Samsung Note 3 for my purposes I love being able to recharge my battery on the go and not need to rely on being next to an outlet all the time. I rely on my phone and always cut it close at the end of the with battery life so I was always it would die on my way home. It is durable but slick which makes it difficult to grip at times. I\\'ve dropped it a couple times so far but it\\'s held up great so far. I am terrified however about scratching the screen as there is no screen protector included. Excellent and Everything in order good I only had it for less than a week, but I\\'m really digging this phone. It\\'s my first smart phone, so I\\'m not speaking with tons of experience.There is a bunch of bloatware on this phone. I installed the ZergRush root:(...)And then Titanium Back-up app which allows backing-up to the SD card and removal of all the crap.Worked great. Still exploring all the capabilities this phone has.The voice recognition seems to work really well. I\\'ve used it a few times with the Google search function when I didn\\'t feel like typing.It has locked-up once while surfing the web which required a battery pull. Re-booted with no ill-effects.A primary attraction to this phone was the availability of T-mobile\\'s $30/mo 100 min/unlimited text and data plan. I wanted a smart phone on a monthly plan, but not the typical $70/mo charge you\\'ve got with a contract. For me, this is an ideal package as I\\'m not a big talker.That being said, read the fine print. This plan is only available via Walmart and T-mobile.com. The catch is that going through either of these sources makes it difficult or impossible to port your old number.To activate my phone, I called T-mobile\\'s porting resolution number at 877-789-3106. They activated my phone and ported my old number, but then despite my request, set me up with the $50/mo unlimited plan. I had to call customer service and do some arm twisting to get on the \"Walmart plan\".In hindsight, it may have been easier to have paid an extra 10 bucks and bought the phone from Walmart.8/8/2012 UPDATE:This sucker runs HOT. Gets pretty warm while websurfing and streaming. Gets scalding hot while running Navigation. It\\'s locked up a few times while running navigation. Pretty much the worst time to have to shut down and restart your phone (while driving).This last time when trying to restart, I got a message stating the battery was too hot, or something to that effect. I\\'ve started removing the case when using the Navigation.I\\'m pretty sure these symptoms are leading up to premature battery failure. Time will tell. Might try a different case to alleviate the issue.Other than that, I\\'m really happy with the phone.7/22/14 UPDATE:Final update. I dumped this phone about 6 months ago. It began to crash, restart and just plain shut down indiscriminately. Part of the problem may have been the SD card, it just didn\\'t have the processing power to handle anything but the simplest apps. Biggest offender might be the latest Facebook updates. Any GPS app also will freeze it up instantly. My wife still has her phone of the same model, and we\\'re getting ready to dump it too for the same issues.This model it just plain obsolete in 2014, and I would not recommend purchasing one at any price. It worked marginally well for the first six months, but after that, it became a turd.The good news is my new Moto X works awesome and I was able to seamlessly transfer my $30/mo 4G plan. Perfect, just what i ordered! Brand new in a box with all accesories. Very very bad experience , my phone is not working well from beginning. Talked to Samsung Canada and USA . They said warranty is not covered in North America and this phone is having technical difficulties from beginning. Also IME number on the phone is not valid for North America as per Samsung support dept.Be careful before buying anything from this seller. PVCS......?????????? Not helpful to customers I really loved this cellphone This phone is brilliant, not sure why they haven\\'t launched it in Europe - I think it would do incredibly well! Excellent GSM unlocked, bought when in the US and brought over to Thailand for main usage. Everything is as listed on description- what was expected of Samsung Galaxy. I thought it was also great that it came with a UK adapter plug. The best personal phone has I spectated. I don\\'t have complain. Still working.but the phone size is to big. The perfect phone. hope it lasts for 50 years. this phone is advertised as a touchscreen and it isnt...it also does not charge all the way and shuts its self off when I am using it. I also got a refurbished phone when I paid for a brand new one. By the time I got my phone, the last day to return it was here and I could not return it so now I am stuck with it. I ordered this device to replace a broken phone. The phone I received was defective. It would not accept my old sim card, not would it accept a new one I picked up at the AT&T store. No matter what you put in, it says \"No Sim\". Do not buy. Had no problem using this under metro PCS. stay away of this phone stop working after month 1/2 waste of money!!! I was a bit skeptical when I was purchasing this phone but now I\\'m 100% satisfied. This is a genuine phone and it comes with all accessories. It performs perfectly and so far I can\\'t complain about anything. Thanks wireless place for your excellent service I returned this phone for the following reasons. First, the wifi would stall CONSTANTLY. It would show connected, but would would send or receive no data until I toggled wifi off and then back on. Happened all the time. It was maddening. And it happened on any wifi network I was connected to. Didn\\'t matter if I changed from 2 to 5 ghz, or if I had the phone keep wifi on all the time in the wifi settings. Second, the phone wouldn\\'t remember accessibility settings. I use Greenify and Clean Master. Both of those apps have advanced features that need to be enabled under accessibility settings. The phone wouldn\\'t remember these settings. I had to toggle them on numerous times per day. Finally, the fingerprint scanner works, but it only worked on the first attempt maybe 1/3 of the time. Your finger needs to be on there just right.Again, not hating on this phone. I liked it. It\\'s solid build and good battery life. Screen is magnificent and it\\'s fast. But because it\\'s a BLU phone, I know that they will never update the software and I\\'d be stuck with these annoyances as long as I own the phone, and I\\'m not willing to do that. If this device ever gets updated to Marshmallow, I will consider purchasing again. So far, I am extremely happy with this phone. MICRO SIM card is a little tricky to install. You have to flip up the silver metal SIM card slot to place sim card in and snap back down. Then lock into place. I could NOT! find any kind of instructions what so ever on this... Not even on YOUTUBE. Phone is nice size, thin, very responsive, great color and economically priced. I got the pink that came with pink cover. I bought this phone as a gift for someone not very familiar with smartphones; I knew it was a cheap device so I did not expect fancy screens or impressive features, but I thought it would make a good entry-level phone.The phone is good looking and nicely packed, and it was relatively easy to use. Not too bad for the price.The downside, it died after 6 months of very light use. We turned the phone off and left it charging during the night, by morning the device was super-hot and would not turn on. We let it cool down, tried again several times with no luck, removed the battery, tried charging again, you name it. No luck at all.The phone is officialy a papaer weight now.... I have to set somethang heavy on the charger to charge my phone n it dies to quick nowhere did the description say the phone was a refurb. i turned on service and got texts for someone else. also everything was in spanish! i needed a translator to change the options!ive had prepaid service 1 day and its crashing. i can\\'t go on the app store. and my balance is $0 after refilling 50$ this afternoon. I\\'ve done nothing!Hoping it straightens out. I convinced my husband to switch to blackberry. In compelled to write a review. I read them consistently, but never write them. You\\'d never know this phone wasn\\'t brand new. My daughter was ecstatic and I saved a lot of money. Delivery was fast as always. Came with earbuds and charger and packaging looked exactly like new iPhone. Loved it!! great a marvel Coolest nice phone its very handy the reception is good not bad for basic phone. Nice phone Got one for my mom. Mom doesn\\'t need a compass. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality (in a good way). Mom loves the phone! Loved the phone. Feels good in hand compared to Nexus 5 . You can see and feel quality. Loved the notifications, and the voice control is the best I\\'ve seen. Photos has bluish tint, but it doesn\\'t matter for me. Excellent buy, speedy delivery, item as described, brand new and sealed in box. My daughter was thrilled and started to use it immediately. It worked great! Review is for shipping and the product. Shipping was perfect, the product was brand new as promised. I love this phone. I wish the battery lasted a little longer but it\\'s a great size for me and the pecfect price. I would never know this was used and reconditioned! This Samsung looks brand new! It came in it\\'s original box with the phone wrapped up. Great presentation. The phone was already charged so I could start using it as soon as I added my SIM card! Much better than my S4. Extremly happy with my phone seller maintained communication description was exact received in a timely manner My little grand son love it. Everything went fast, just the way was pictured. Best seller. Thank you Georgeta I had to go pick from a u.p.s office The iPhone is not factory unlocked as advertised Really slow but it reliable My Experience was Great , The Phone was in Good Condition. Actually what I expected. I Would definitely recommend to others The phone works perfectly, works good with Venezuelan networks (haven\\'t tested it with Digitel yet). Awesome device, fast, and everything that it\\'s supposed to do. Originally this product received a 5 star rating from me,that is until 8 months later and the charging port decides to not take a charge anymore. I am past the window for return for an obvious defect in the manufacturing of the product and am very upset. The product didn\\'t even last a full year before breaking down. Would never purchase again and offer this as a future buyer beware for anyone interested in these phones The phone is fully functional and isn\\'t scratched on the front or anything, so it\\'s perfect if you are looking for an HTC Incredible.That said, on the back cover of one of the phones (I bought 2) the shiny plastic \"HTC\" logo was missing the HT, so I pulled out the C and it looks like nothing is missing. One of the phones came with a wall adapter for the USB cable, and the other did not.As for the phone it\\'s self, it is a bit outdated so some newer apps may not work, but it is quick and outright awesome. I would look up more thorough reviews if you aren\\'t sure if an Incredible is right for you, but if it is, then this is definitely the one to buy. Going to war? Don\\'t forget your Otter Box.The screen protector adds some resistance that I don\\'t like. I may remove it. Otherwise solid overall. I really like the cover and integral kickstand. this specific phone is very reliable, affordable, and easy to use. it is a good size as well, not too big-not too small. The charger never worked Everything is perfect It works on Ecaudor!!!! to used in the usa is horrible... Beats all android cheap phones. Functions adequately. I did not get what is shown in the picture. The picture shows an otterbox clip. I just got a flimsy clip. This phone is awesome, ive had allot of phones but this one is by far the best ive ever had, i owned the nokia 1020 and K zoom cause the camera on a phone is the most important feature, i loved both of those phones but this one is far better, the video\\'s this phone produces are beautiful, if you were to buy this phone just for being a camera you will be extremely pleased, also the specs are good enough to play any game the android market has available, also the body of this phone is very nice, removable back plate for swapping battery, and metal frame are awesome, only negatives with this phone are no memory card slot and no optical stabilization. If you wish to see the video quality for yourself click the link below for my youtube channel.https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnWW7mkP6ToWFeUo_VrsKTwCUN5b2Hxqc This phone is one of samsungs best product yet iPhone,nokia, illumina, htc or anyother android phone can not compare loving it exito the product is excellent and the response by the seller is quite fast and effective, I recommend one hundred percent Good phone. Be careful when buying a case for this phone. I really love this phone, I am going to buy another one for a back up. Great Phone! great Amazing! Got an iPhone 5c that looks like a brand new phone! We had one small issue with the charger, but customer service was awesome and got the problem taken care of immediately. They were very nice and beyond helpful. This is the second phone we have gotten and they have both been amazing! Would definitely reccommend this to anybody! This phone is great went from a Note 4 which was also a great phone but after 2 years started to crap out on me. For only a $400 price tag this phone is definitely worth considering and rivals alongside the other flagship devices such as the iPhone 6s or Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. This phone works phenomenally and I have yet to experience any lag. I don\\'t know why all the tech reviewers are ragging on the camera when the outstanding photos, albeit low light is quite noisy. I also love the dash charging as I am able to get up in the morning do my routine and leave my phone charging for 30 minutes and have 90% battery and be ready to go about my day. I highly recommend this device. Only bad thing about this product was that it did not come with a factory USB samsung cable. It was some kind of vietnam made cable, and rather than charge my phone, it would have the lightning bolt like it was charging, but it absolutely would not charge. I had to charge it in my car last night to get my phone to charge. Other than that, phone works pretty well best phone ever! It is a beautiful phone, works like it is supposed too, and has a nice premium weight to it. I will be returning for the BLU Life One, however, I am a satisfied customer. YouTube does crash from time to time and games are slow but those are not complaints just observations. two out of 3 phones i purchased has already stopped working and its been only 4 months and they will not help. I was sold a failed unlock phone that was no longer compatible with sprint. Not only this but the device arrived greasy and dirty. When using headphones in this phone the right ear doesn\\'t work! phones is nice otherwise tho. what can be done to fix this? very good excellent The best phone I ever own, I watch a lot of videos on it. It came so fast I was surprised. I even bought one for my hubby and he blaggs about it to his friends. I simply love this phone. This company Rocks! It arrived in 24hr! Great servic, great packaging, brand new, no problems! I highly recommend this to all! Good phone but battery is dieing really quick I was a little skeptical about buying electronics online especially a phone, I hesitated whether or no I should buy it but I\\'m glad I did it was in perfect condition and the exact same model as described very happy with my purchase. Good This phone does everything that I want my phone to and then some. Don\\'t expect a flagship phone like apple products or Samsung, but instead expect a well equipped phone for under 150. I have had this for a week and I can say that I love it more than I did my galaxy s4 active. The screen is beautiful, the design and feel are great, the size is on our with a note 4, I can\\'t complain about the speeds or connections, and the battery life is great.Obviously you do lose some features, by none of the features lost are things that I really miss anyways. The camera is a little slow to focus, but the picture quality is great. It takes a little getting used to not having some sort of button on the devices screen, but now that I am I don\\'t see any reason for the extra buttons.I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a long life, easy to use, beautiful looking and functioning smart phone for under 150. Just bought the HTC One M7 \"New\" from BuyMe LLC and it clearly isn\\'t new. The screen is slightly damaged, the bottom left of it is slightly elevated above the frame as if something didn\\'t snap into place, and the original packaging differs from what I\\'ve seen in un-boxing videos, in fact, it came with a windows phone booklet instead of an android one. Also, the earbuds seem very used, the paint on them is worn and both buds show that they are for the right ear. The screen is incredible. Like really incredible. The resolution is better than my eye can see. I use a Galaxy S4 as my regular phone and it has great resolution where you can\\'t see individual pixels. I thought the S4 screen was as good as you can get, but the S6 screen takes it to a whole new level. Even though you can\\'t see pixels on either screen, the higher resolution of the S6 screen makes everything look so sharp that it\\'s nearly impossible to tell you are looking at a screen. It\\'s that incredible.The design of the phone just feels more \\'expensive\\'. I mean that in a good way. It feels just higher quality than previous models in the Galaxy S line. The S3 and S4 for example are often critiqued for having a plastic shell. The S6 has a metal band around the outside that just makes it feel \\'premium\\' in your hand. It should also provide more protection for the device as well.TouchWiz is HEAVILY scaled back. I hate TouchWiz (Samsung\\'s version of Android) It adds a layer of UI that is neither helpful nor intuitive. And it\\'s a resource hog which slows the phone down for important tasks just so it can make the scrolling smoother, and other such useless tradeoffs. On the S6 TouchWiz was barely noticeable. The UI looks more like the standard Google Android Lollipop interface. It was all just much smoother and simpler and better and wonderful. I finally ended up going with the s6 since it seems like the usability rating was much higher and I didn\\'t want to end up being an apple fanboy.. check out that site if you want to see the different phone models in a side by side comparison. works perfect for Telcel GSM!! (Mexico) Phone looks great as a refurbished, almost as new 98% Let me just say that this came so quick it was crazy. I wasn\\'t expecting it so soon. It was bigger than I thought, but it\\'s a really flattering phone. It works wonderfully! Thanks so much! Love my phone . It was used but it look brand NEW! The only thing I wasn\\'t impressed with is that she sent me fake iPhone headsets but that\\'s okay. Overall great seller. I recommend this seller. @Sharri International Inc \\'i got the green one \\' If I there\\'s an option for no star rating, I will do it for this lousy phone for couples of reasons. It\\'s a brand-new factory unlocked phone that I purchase less than 2 weeks ago. It works as supposed for the first few days but shows signs of un-stability in the second week. Sometimes I have to press the home button twice to make it work. When I surf web on Safari, the screen does not rotate anymore! I\\'m coordinating with the Seller to get it return now. Compared to a Nokia 925 that I have been using for over a year, iphone 6 plus is suck. exelente As advertised very satisfied with product. Love it Well, not much to say about Samsung product in General. I have been using Samsung product for a long time and I like it. The initial price for unlocked phone is too expensive, but if you stay for about two months and price always drops at least by $200.00. However, it cost less compared to unlocked iPhone. Excelent i bought 2 of these and still trying to figure out how to use them and all it came when was a little piece of paper for instructions! I even had my phone company look at it and they couldnt get it to work!! All good Terrible phone. Cheaply made, hard to hear anyone and it stopped working after 30 days. Don\\'t waste your money. Good TODO PERFECTAMENTE BIEN.. RECOMENDADO 100% Hi Everyone,I would \\'ve given -ve rating if it\\'s possible. I ordered a new Unlocked Nokia phone from this seller and what I received was totally surprising. First of all it was not an unlocked phone instead it was an AT&T phone which was in a contract period. Moreover they send the phone inside an plastic envelop with a duplicate battery charger, apparently without any accessories and manuals.I contacted the seller for the refund then he started giving excuses like you should \\'ve read the details. It was clearly mentioned on Amazon that its a NEW and UNLOCKED phone with all accessories. Somehow I was able to convince him for the refund and shipped the phone back to the seller\\'s address given by the seller himself.Its been more than three months now and I didnt even get a penny back. The seller is saying that he didnt receive it back however I confirmed from the shipping company that it was delivered on the destination on time.I lost my money and still didnt get the phone I ordered. I had to order another phone from some other seller.So guys think twice before you even visit this seller\\'s page on Amazon. Friendly advice to all of you find some other seller. Trust me you dont wanna get into this kinda mess !! I Hope this review would save atleast some customers from this seller. Excellent Phone. it good Compared to my 2 year old HTC phone, this one is night and day. Works great, lots of memory, and the speakers in the front makes listening to applications much better. I was able to install all my apps that were on my old phone and much more. Now the biggest surprise has been the battery life. My old phone would be out of juice with any intensive app use or by the end of the day if I was lucky. I actually went two days without charging and it still had battery charge. Very happy and highly recommend. Excelente Good thanks It is an amazing phone Please do not buy these phones as they will not last long. i bought 3 of them and all of them stop functioning within 3 months of use. Excellent! Very reliable. Good easy phone to use. Not full of technology but served it\\'s purpose. This phone was stolen, but workd great for the time I had it. Really big upgrade from my old and slow Galaxy s3. I did have to go to T-Mobile to get a nano sim card though. But they did it for free. I don\\'t use it much and the battery life is at 90% at the end of the day. However I noticed on days where I Used Google Maps as a GPS in the car for a couple hours, it was already almost out of battery. I like Android because it\\'s easy to work with on my computer. I just put an mp3 on it to use as my ringtone. The fingerprint scanner thing on the back works well and is in a comfortable spot. I LOVE.. IT to the max! Excellent product Ty worked for 11 weeks Surprisingly good quality phone considering the low price compared to other phones. Have had it for over a week and dropped it twice and did not break or scratch. Has a decent amount of space with options to upgrade. Able to play all my games without any lag and plenty of room on the screen to see everything. This item does not work with iPhone. Nor can you download any app for the phone to work. This phone is awesome!!!. Does practically the same thing most high end expensive phone would do for a very low cost!! I tuned on the phone initially was bright and the picture quality great but could be a bit brighter for when you are in the sunlight out doors. Very light weight.Texture at back of phone has a nice feel. Speakers are loud enough for music but not while on a phone call. Does not come with earphones which was my disappointment; only the phone, the battery and a charger. Have to charge battery every night though. The battery goes down quickly if your doing lots of stuff and have apps running. Fully charged within 3-4 hrs. Fairly fast to fit your speed but is more efficient when you boost the phone or clear the cache or RAM. Needs additional memory for music and pics so a SD memory card would be good. Got the phone everything lg was expected. The battery doesn\\'t last at all. Its terrible. Also the phone stays hot like a damn Samsung phone would. Had a great lg phone b4 decided to stick with a lg. The back of the phone is burning up hot. You can barely touch the volume, power button. I say look into the g4 or g5 lg I was replacing a lost 4s and this was exactly the thing I needed. Good description and the unit performs well. Got as a replacement for a Galaxy SII- absolutely worth it. Great phone! Bought it for my mom and she loves it!! Dependable seller!! Everything works well phone looks almost brand new however I recieved the wrong charger port. Blackberry Curve 9360 Unlocked Quad-Band 3G GSM Phone with 5MP Camera, QWERTY Keyboard, GPS and Wi-Fi - US Warranty - BlackLAMENTO DECIR QUE MI EXPERIENCIA CON ESTE VENDEDOR FUE MUY MALA. Pésimo producto. Recibí teléfono bloqueado.Solamente en idioma inglés generó gastos extras (Venezuela).Sus sellos estaban violentados. PARECÍA REPARADO PREVIAMENTE. It is just as fast and good as my friends\\' Samsung Galaxy S6s. Great price for a quality phone. didn\\'t work well with my phone. Ever since I have had the Note 4, I experience random crashes and rebooting. It does not matter what time of day or what application I am using. It crashes and automatically reboots. Since I am in IT I have waited patiently for a firmware fix. I figured there had to be one. After more than 6 months I have not been able to find a fix!.Has anyone else had this problem? If so, were you able to fix? Excellent My teenage daughter had just received this phone for her birthday in march and recently lost it. This is exact phone. good I originally purchased Good phone does everything a smartphone should . So nice phone and very cheap I have had this product for a month and a half and it stopped working. Start up screen and that\\'s it. I was pleased but now am not because it\\'s brand new and stopped working. Phone was advertised as new, but was defective. Took it to the apple store and they said it came up on their computer as recycled. HMMMM Am having to return it. Camera broke 3 week after I got the phone. Nnice product, I would recommend. Good Phone So Far No Problems!! My husband is not a technogeek. This phone is what he wants. I got it for Father\\'s Day, and it arrived on time. I have not used it yet, but the seller sent me information on what to do if I have any problems. Sure it will be better than the five year old phone he has now. Excelent I AM SO DISSAPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT.THIS PHONE REFUSED TO WORK IN DECEMBER THIS YEAR.I AM CRUSHED.I WISH I COULD GET A REFUND.I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING ELECTRONIC ONLINE.I LIVE IN TRINIDAD,WEST INDIES Phone was exactly how it was described This watch is great. I have all the Samsung watches and I love them all. Beyond what I expected, all friends and Family would like to own a device as this one but due to price change the decided not to buy.Device looks like a Iphone 6 Plus, battery life is awesome, picture are clear not as sharp. The Batery is now starting to give problems! Purchased as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. Definitely a step up from his Iphone 4s. Did not have any problems getting it activated by Verizon. Works beautifully. phone keep stating no SIM card,when card was put in;card from AT&T gsm used.will return. I had the S4 and i thought it was the best phone i ever had, wowo this S5 is much more nicer. I love the futures it came withI have no issues whatsoever. For the price i think it was cool I bought this cell like 3 weeks ago and is acting weird already, It erases my contacts all the time, sometimes won\\'t let me send messages and the it won\\'t let me make calls. I had to buy another cell. I hated the sidekick. Oh yeah and the internet does not work at all!!! Love the phone. It exceeded my expectations with only one day of use my cell damage the screen I did an excellent purchase about, a great phone and the best and faster shipping!Im from Venezuela and it works perfectly with 3G network, just teel to H&P that provides a 1,2 and 6 bands for Movistar cause bands 1, 4 and 8 just works with Digitel It was slow not what i expected small screen operating system sucked couldnt do much with it I needed a simple but uesful phone. If you don\\'t need a smart phone but one that is waht phones were ment to be this one is good. Unless you have very small hands, don\\'t even think about getting this. I had to return this item because after charging it for 7 hours afternI got it, it wasn\\'t charging at all! Not to have any issues whatsoever, I decided to return it instead. I guess thats the price you pay. i like it Bought this item for my younger sister in Guyana, yeah another country and she loves it. She\\'s been texting me ever since. Great device Hopefully, the iphone user in my house will not destroy his iphone with this case. Love the fit and the look. Great value for the price! excellent, very good excelente This phone does everything I want it to and more. Full anndroid market access. Built in GPS. Screen size is good and all apps run smoothly. Well worth the money. Great phone... Battery was half full, like always with these things, put in my Tmobile sim card and it worked right away.. Its exactly the same size as my S1, which is what i wanted. Absolutely adore this phone, however I dropped it the 2 week I had it and cracked the screen. :(The sound is great! and the camera came with cool beauty tool and pose thing. I greatly enjoy using the cameras. The phone arrived on time. Works great. My teenage daughter is happy. What else can I say...also a great price. Its good, just doesn\\'t connect to bluetooth headphones GREAT this doesnt come with headphones THE PHONE I PURCHASED IS REPLACING MY OLD ONE. I AM HAPPY TO HAVE ORDERED THROUGH YOU, GETTING IT ON TIME BEFORE THANKSGIVING..IT WORKS VERY WELL, AND PERFORMS BUCH BETTER THAN MY OLD BB.THANK YOU FOR THE GOOD SERVICE As a low cost smartphone you can\\'t go wrong with this device, since it a Motorola you will get the latest OS updates fairly quickly and the battery last all day. Good battery lift. bought it for my daughter and she is very happy with the phone.Good build quality. The shipping was very fast! I bought this for a friend who has a plan for no smart phones....works like a champ! So far a good phone, my daughter broke her other phone, did want to buy an expensive phone yet, so I brought this one and she loves it, she did say the camera was not that good buy overall it\\'s good for a teenager. excellent for texting! like that the front is touch! very wide screen and neat layout! has excellent speaker and clear. Have bought few of this phones recently. First of all was pleased by ergonomic, second surprise was touch screen... I\\'ve been an user of 5800 for quiet long time and I hated its touch screen, Nokia was always bad with touches. When I switched to iPhone I have realized how much I was suffering from it. But this phone is another story, it actually responds with 99% precision to your touch. Nice screen with good font size. Camera is OK though I prefer cameras on SE. But the most amazing thing about this phone is a price! For 139$ this is a steal! You get nice looking phone with 3,5G Wi-Fi and 5mpx Camera with touch screen on top of it.Must have! WORKS VERY GOOD FOR WHAT I NEED IT FOR . Yessur I\\'m still trying to figure out how to download music up on my phone.. Can anyone help me with that??? Outside of that the phone is great It\\'s a good phone. I had big problems with the Tune In app for Windows. There was no toggle to move to place in recorded programs, and if there was a streaming issue, the program would reset to the beginning with no way to bring it back to where I was. Eventually, I brought back my Fire Phone back into service with a renewed appreciation of what it provided. A great buy. A good working phone. I loved the plum color. It was a Christmas gift for a family member and so so good It works well, but I can\\'t eliminate the advertisement that I don\\'t use Verizone. I think that they have unblocked the cellphone but not 100% good. Another good protective case for my cell from Otterbox. Bought this one for the belt clip.Nice and at a good price. The only lacking thing is front camera ! Rest, perfect !! Ideal for the islands came to me with the home button broken and had many problems with trying to charge the phone fixed that 30$ later and has now just broke after 4 months of use. Was not dropped or treated badly in anyway es bien Wife uses it every day and carries it on all trips from home. Still going strong! bought it for my wife. She dropped it in the toilet and we cleaned it up with alcohol and sticking it in rice. The dual sim is a cool feature but you have to set up everything each time. We use it for the BVI between the USVI and the VPN has to be put in now and then This seller has outstanding professionalism. He went above and beyond to deliver a great product to me. The only flaw in this item was the description said it has a front facing camera, and it doesn\\'t. But I enjoyed my buying experience and no doubt I would recommend this seller to anyone seeking an affordable smart phone. perhaps because i used a HTC Butterfly before using this phone, I found this phone significantly underpowered... The phone finds it hard to keep up with my multi-tasking demands. But for a phone this cheap, I\\'d rather say it is a relatively good buy. If you\\'re looking for a phone at a low price, I would definitely suggest this phone because it does quite well for it\\'s price point. Excelent The best phone ever made Awesome would recomend Back in March of this year I submitted a wonderful review about the seller and the fact that my product was shipped so quickly. HOWEVER, and unfortunately for me the phone itself DIED a few weeks ago. And on my birthday no less! I\\'ve already bought new batteries and a desktop battery charger and it is still acting wonky. Sigh...all I wanted was a working Droid. I got a lifeless hand ornament. Thanks a lot! Never...again... Great Phone! Nice but sometimes it\\'s too slow. I do not know if these reviews are seller specific but I order the phone from \"Next Level Mobile\" which was labeled as \"new\" after around 3.5 months the display was not working, when I brought it to Apple they said they could not fix the problem because it has been replaced with a \"third party display\". I bought my HTC 8x new from a retail seller on Amazon. It was new and unopened. However, after 4 months, the three buttons on the bottom stopped functioning. I have never dropped it and always take great care of it. I thought HTC has good quality, but this happened within 4 months! So I sent it back to HTC and provided all receipts to proof that I only had this for 4 months, HTC still wants to charge me since HTC does not cover phones not purchased from Amazon. Be aware of it! It may stop function in a short time, and if you are going to buy it from any other sellers , check with them first to see if your phone is covered with warrantee. Great ítem! Like new I tried a few that were okay. After reading the reviews , I chose this cute case and I love it.It fits perfectly, my phone is protected and it\\'s really pretty. Excelent!!! totally fake product. Samsung logo wasn\\'t there on phone. The phone started freezing the very same day. The video gives Xray effect in all video and camera. Camera freezes every time. No way looks an original phone. Returned the product. Muy bien gracias. Haven\\'t activated this phone yet, as it is a Christmas gift, but the phone is in great condition (as described). So far, I am extremely satisfied with this purchase. Will update this review, if it is necessary.Update: We absolutely love this phone and I am very satisfied with the purchase. My friend love his phone Excellent recommend 100% Excelent Good phone. No complaints so far. Could easily be a five I like the set up of this phone, the touch buttons on the face of the phone make it easy to navigate. I wish it was a little thinner I am happy about the purchase i only have a couple of downfalls. one is i didnt kno the phone was so small,from the pictures and actually looking at it on youtube and stuff it looked bigger. it came with everything it suppose to. the sony Xperia is a practical and modern phone. i like it because have a perfect size and wide. i recomended it I\\'ll be the first 2-star review. This is definitely a bare-bones basic phone. But if a phone has a camera, I expect that I should be able to send picture texts. I got this to replace another Nokia phone. I figured since this was a newer model, it should have picture message capabilities. Not so!! No picture texts, and to me that is a basic functionality. Other than that, it\\'s a decent phone. But I\\'m sending it back because I can\\'t live without picture texts. It was a great phone too bad it got stolen from my purse at waltmart the next day :( good phone.. owner is berry happy... can no complaing Phone is decent. However the OS tweaks that HTC has done to it have made it less accessible. I bought it for my wife for ease of use it supposedly had. She has had a difficult time with it. One example is the fact you have to press and hold the #1 digit to access voicemail. Completely unintuitive! In retrospect I should have gotten her a Samsung which has a much better layout without the worthless multi feed interface. Only reason I did not score it lower was the hardware quality is excellent. Lovely phone does everything I needs it to do. Great price & it works with my T-MOBILE sim card. I had 2 phones from T-MOBILE and they were very defective had to be replaced 3 times & same result. I\\'ll never buy any phone from T-MOBILE ever again. I was so amazed from the time I purchased this Blu phone. It\\'s amazing what this phone can do & it is very high tech. I am very pleased. I had a HTC One before the M8. It is lightning fast, latest Android version, incredible display, incredible camera, battery lasts 3 days using always 3g (no wi-fi)!! My \"iPhone\" friends were very impressed. Very well finished. The phone is great for the price. Great phone and fast shipping We received the phones extremely fast. They work fine with straight talk. Everything went smoothly to add them to the account. I did have to have straight talk walk me through how to change a setting to be able to send picture messages, but it was very easy. We love the phones. We chose these over the iPhone s3 because of the functions we wanted on it. We can Skype with the front facing camera. The calendar, e-mail, etc. sync just fine. Has tons of fun features to make using it easy. Overall we are very happy with this purchase and the seller. Does this phone S6 G920l work in Trinidad And Tobago ? I have used it for a month. it turned out to be a real revolution! This is the first time I use Samsung smartphone and I feel it is a wise choice. Get compliments all the time Great Blackberry S m a r t P h o n e 8 5 2 0 at a reasonable cost. #NAME? I love Apple, just not this particular phone, it worked for a day and then when I would make or receive calls I would here a terrible noise. This phone started off great but considering where I am now, great meant that it functioned properly. I gone through two of these phones, neither of which worked properly. The first started out okay but the battery saver glitched the UI to oblivion so I did what any rational human being and returned it requesting a new one.The second time, I saw the replacement arrive in the mail. I was happy, finally a phone to replace my aging Nokia 822. It started out as one glitch, the battery saver and that\\'s it. It was not as severe as the last one so I didn\\'t worry. Now though, in the past two day this waste of money has started glitching all over again, doing nothing like it is supposed to. It is sending multiple text messages to my contacts, not receiving messages, UI glitching out.DON\\'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS PHONE This is one of the zippiest and smoothest working Windows phones. It is obviously not the best phone out there, but it is great nonetheless. The major issues, as many will attest, are with the recent bout of Windows updates that vary in effectiveness. However, after testing Windows 10 on a few low-end devices, the 950 is leaps and bounds better! I wanted a cheap fitness tracker with clock.The Bad: The pedometer said unavailable, the sleep tracker said unavailable, and I could only find the sedentary alert once- don\\'t know if that worked.The Middle: The band on it is huge. I\\'m a big girl that usually uses extra links in a watch, and I was on the second to last hole here. It\\'s thicker and heavier than I expected, but I think I would get used to it.The Good: Even though I didn\\'t want to connect it to my phone, it connected easily to my iPhone 6. I could get my music, even though it wasn\\'t very loud. I liked the idea of an FM radio. Even though the headphones didn\\'t fit, good sound quality. excellent Enjoying my phone! Great 2g in t-mobile Excellent Camera stopped working on the second day after release and simply states \"Unfortunately the camera has stopped working\". A quick google search revealed this is a common problem with Sony phones.On 8/11/2016 another update was released and now bluetooth doesn\\'t connect.I am using the Ultra with T-mobile USA. The phone had no problem connecting to the network once the sim card was inserted but it takes for ever to initiate the call. After dialing a number or selecting a contact to call it takes a good 10-20 seconds for the dial tone to start. These calls are made in a major city and I have never had this problem with other cell phones.Coming from a note 5, the screen quality isn\\'t the best. I was willing to sacrifice resolution for size but at this point I regret the purchase. I will be returning this phone due too all the problems. I wish there was more storage, but what I can say is that I really like this phone. Pictures are great! I have had it now for about 4 months and am very satisfied. It is just like the Galaxy everybody is going crazy over, I think the 5s or something. Whatever it is my sister has it, only I paid alot less for mine! muy bien It\\'s perfect!!! Fantastic phone and fantastic dealer. Thanks!! Great for the money. Big screen size and performance. More of the same and for a very high price... Everything good I HAVE PURCHASED 30 CELL PHONES...THEY DONT REACH MY EXPECTATIONS FOR VARIUOS REASONS SUCH AS DONT TAKE SIM CARDS, CAME WITH MISSING PATRS( BATTERIES, BACK COVERS, SCREEN, BOOKLETS,CHARCHERS.) AND I WANT TO RETURN THEM I IS A NIGHTMATE..PROCESS IS TAKING FOR EVER. It was very nice and it looks like it came with a brand new charger and headphones! Awesome and Thank you! This phone literally fell out of my lap and the screen shutoff completely.Definitely not worth it apparently even with the low price.It\\'s great that my warranty on this ended 10 days before the device broke so nothing I can do. Works good. Takes excellent pictures. Love it. Top demais recomendo Great phone so far! excellent functionality!!!! excelent I am impressed with this phone, it meet my expection of it so far and the battery is very very good. I am in love with this phone so much. Service is excellent. It came right away and I am extremely satisfied of my new product. This here is an excellent price as well. Go to your carriers or even another party and the cost of this is like $600 which is bad. Not only that you have to pay it monthly. This was excellent and if my friends or family members need it I will be sure to direct them here. Thank you so much Amazon for putting a big smile on my face. the phone arrived on time and is exactly as described. Having trouble understanding the dual sim cards and trying to figure out how to activate it and what company to go with I wanted a replacement cellphone and didn\\'t want any kind of smartphone or mp3-playing phone or camera-phone, etc. So I ordered the cheapest phone available on Amazon, which turned out to be this one. I\\'ve been happy with it; it does everything I need, and it was easy to figure out how it works without having to read the instruction manual (which was in Spanish anyway).My only complaint is that because it\\'s not a flip-phone, the buttons are exposed and so sometimes they get pressed when the phone is in my pocket. But I\\'m sure I can get a phone cover or something, if I decide that this is too annoying. This is a great cell phone! I love it. tal cual como lo describió el vendedor totalmente satisfecho recomiendo a esta tienda muy buena atención excelente y llego rapido. GOOD great dual sim phone for a family member in Jamaica First of all, for the price, it can\\'t be beat! The features and apps aren\\'t quite as refined as the Samsung phones but overall it works quite well. It seems to work well with my T-Mobile account and shows LTE most of the time here in the North Metro Atlanta area. This is actually my second one, the first lasted about 36 hours and just quit flat the first time i warmed it up by turning on the GPS. Amazon took amazing care of the problem and I had a replacement within two days even though i called them on a weekend.The limited color choices are annoying. Come on, I\\'m a business guy, give me a black phone! The least goofy color available was white with a clear silicone protective case and after two weeks it\\'s starting to show, especially stuff getting in between the case and the phone. Clear case / white phone: EVERYTHING shows.None of the makers of accessories seem to know about Blu and good luck finding cases and holsters. It\\'s the same size as the Galaxy Note 3 so things that fit the GN3 should fit the Blu. Since spare batteries are also hard (impossible?) to find, plan on keeping it plugged in just in case whenever you can. Battery life isn\\'t bad but it won\\'t last a full 14-16 hour day of use like my old Blackberry did.My only serious beef is that the GPS is pitifully weak. Laying on the dash of my car it only occasionally locks on and the rest of the time is searching for satellites. I\\'ve noticed that the Bluetooth connection is also significantly weaker than my previous phones and those of others in my family. Since i INTENDED to use it in the cockpit as a backup moving map the GPS thing is a serious drawback for me but I\\'ve decided that I\\'ll keep it as just a phone. This is the best phone so far, everything about it is great. The quality of the videos and pictures are amazing. The only reason i don\\'t rate five stars is because of the key board, its hard to space words because of it. Other than that its an amazing product and recomend it for those who want a good phone but cant afford those newer model, expensive phones. Este telefono, es excelente es super rapido con el wifi, era un regalo cual a mi hija le encanto, el color lila super bello, es un telefono que se puede recomentar para la chicas jovenes le sacan mucho provecho - The headphones stopped working after a few moths- The touch screen doesn\\'t always respond- The lock button stopped working almost immediately- Had to get SIM card tray replaced- Battery only lasts 10 hours with minimal useWhen I was first getting this p Great cell phone for college students! Functional and economic! I bought two of these phones because I wanted to surprise my friends, who were going away on a trip and both of them needed new phones. I looked at many different smart phones on here, specifically with 4G LTE, which in itself narrows the selection. This phone stood out to me. The price seemed ok, the specs sounded fine and the reviews were encouraging. So I bought two. I was excited about getting them, and giving them away but the joy of the surprise didn\\'t last very long. Both phones have inaccurate sensors. If I tap a letter in the top row, it gives me language selection. I need four, sometimes five attempts to open an app because it doesn\\'t respond to lighter touch. It becomes extremely annoying when you type a message and it frequently inserts a suggestion, just because you typed the letter slightly upward. Even for a budget phone like this one, I expected better adjustment. I also couldn\\'t, like in my own phone, (which was the same price but seems a much better quality) calibrate the sensor to have a more accurate typing experience. There was no way to fix this.As I gave the two phones away, the frustration was high as I felt I had made a bad choice. I am returning at least one of them and have already ordered a phone of which I know that it works.There is some good about these phones however. The wifi is relatively fast and the phone itself is fast in opening apps for example. The screen is very clear and almost looks like a retina screen, very high quality. The colors are vibrant. This phone comes with a screen protector and a slim silicone case. All of that is absolutely great and I like that the sellers do sell a product with thought behind it. But all the good doesn\\'t help if the one thing that makes a phone useable, being able to type or press on a symbol is not working well. Great price. Works like a charm. If you are looking for a high quality smartphone, and great service, SoonerSoft Electronics will be the right choice ! Yes it works great Everything seems perfect except that the front camera is not too sharp for me. Perfect condition. Nice phone, works good and looks beautiful. The only thing I feel not so appreciating is that it is an unlocked AT&T. love it! Best phone for its price. No other phone in the same price range comes close to what you get from 920. Works great for Straight Talk. I am enjoying my new phone. I still have a lot to learn about it. Just bought a new cover for it. Love this phone easy to use and lots of great apps Additional review after owning this item for 14 months:After owning this phone for 14 months, I must say I love this phone more and more each day. Today, I successfully connected my ipad to this phone through bluetooth to get on internet without Wi-Fi. There is no problem with emails and general browsing. I even watched a video, although interrupted a couple times. Unlike my other phone, this phone making switching on/off bluetooth and adding/deleting pairing devices very simple and secure.FIY: I do have unlimited grandfather data plan with this phone.--------------------------------------------------------Original reivew after owning this item for 8 months:I have own this phone for 8 months and have travelled to Asia with it.I must say I was not very used to a phone with full keyboard. And the full keyboard is not very useful to me as I do not text messaging/email a lot. In fact, it gave me quite some headache at first as so many phone numbers were remembered as letters in US (such as 4-police). However, after all the time being, I like it more and more.It is not a smart phone. However, it serves the purposes to surf internet such as for checking Train schedule, weather...etc. Unlike my another Window phone which will get on line without my permissions and caused me $$$ and endless trouble with phone bills, this Nokia C3 phone has very clear and easy operate WLAN controls and warning to allow me to always choose the right WLAN provider.Not like some other easy broken toy-like phones, this phone has a decent look and is nicely built. The battery life is desirably long which makes it a perfect travel companion.And recently, I notice NOKIA provides many free games for downloading that I spent quite a good time playing them. This adds another plus for a long travel.I am happy to give this light weight pocket size phone 5 stars. Excellent device ... The battery life is fantastic. Simplifying the software is definitely a big improvement. The screen is outstanding, adding fingerprint sensor and a heart. The back deck and its famous holes make it difficult to slip out of hand. And resistance to water and dust to IP67 certificate is something that should be almost mandatory in all móviles.La camera always produces spectacular photos as there is enough light and is best HDR video recording. MIMO and 4G WiFi connection are quick and the power and performance is more than enough games to entertain even complex graphics. In Venezuela it works fine with operators. Perfect delivery timing since I was about to travel outside the country and had No issues to get a line since the phone was unlocked.Phone has all the features to be a great working/business tool, fast and easy and also great for entertainment: awesome camera, great sound for music. I LOVE IT and so did my brother, so I had to leave it for him as a present jajaja Nice it looks like a 007 James bond movie pretty cool watch everybody likes My watch 5 Stars a Winn RUN FROM THIS SELLER AND DONT LOOK BACK, I bought this I phone 32gb and when I got it headed to the ATT store to activate the phone. Long and behold it would not activate, the sim card would not read. I was told to go to the APPLE store to see if they can figure it out which I did. It turns out that it was NOT A 32 gb iphone but a 16gb, the phone was a damaged phone and should have never been sold. THIS SELLER IS A BAD BUSINESS PERSON. RUNNNNNNNNN Work great. I love this phone. I changed it from the Galaxy S5. I only have problems with finding out where the videos are, but eventually I will figure it out. el producto es igual a la foto y estaba bien empaquetado y llego a venezuela en excelente estado gracias sigan asi Quick & easy to put together and to get it up & running! I bought this for my wife for her birthday and she loves it hasn\\'t had any problems with the phone Everything worked out as stated. phone is really worth for money but the only complaint is with LTE with AT&T, there is no band support with the n/w provider for this phone. Update as of Oct. 25, 2015: I did buy another used VX8300 here. It appears to have been deactivated in 2008 and does not have the 2011 MDR code update. I\\'ve found a cell tech in Seattle who says he can get the software. If so, I\\'ll post the info. Sure do love this old school phone.--------Got my first VX8300 nine years ago. If I hadn\\'t lost it I\\'m sure it would still be working. I replaced it with a second VX8300, which worked fine til I dropped it for the umpteenth time a couple days ago. Actually, the lower portion of the phone still works, but the video screen is toast. So, what to do about a replacement?I spent several hours today researching the new LG Terra VN210, which was recommended to me. It\\'s not even in the same ballpark as the nine year old VX8300. The VN210 has no microSD slot, it has no video capability, its battery is only 950 mAh compared to 1100 on the VX8300, one reviewer says the VN210 lacks EVDO and is limited to 1X, it\\'s 20% bigger and has the same 1.3MP camera the nine year old VX8300 has! That\\'s an improvement?So, obviously I\\'m considering another VX8300. But there\\'s one big drawback that I haven\\'t seen mentioned in 28 pages of Amazon reviews: The March 25, 2011 Qualcomm MDR code upgrade that left thousands of Verizon LG users out in the cold. In a nutshell, if you didn\\'t have the phone turned on when the MDR codes were sent down the line, your phone would \"Error (3332)\" and you could no longer access GetItNow or your Backup Assistant. The codes were only selectively distributed for a short time to various Verizon stores and Tier 2 techs in certain regions, then pulled by Verizon corporate.Verizon should have stepped up and dealt with the problem immediately, but they let it fester and spent months dodging the issue while orphaned users screamed at them. Of course, I didn\\'t know about this til I\\'d already bought a replacement phone that wasn\\'t turned on when the upgrade was done. After months of back-and-forth frustration with Verizon, I finally wound up shipping my phone 2000 miles to a Verizon store in Ohio, which was apparently the only store in the nation with a tech who both understood the problem AND still had the MDR codes in her system! Took her five minutes to do the fix. I was lucky to find her information posted in the Verizon forum. Otherwise...So, to all of you who\\'ve purchased a VX8300 and posted here in the last four years, can you access GetItNow/Media center? Do you have access to Backup Assistant? How about VZNavigator? Do you have the updated Qualcomm MDR codes? I\\'d like to know before I buy another VX8300, because I sure don\\'t want to go through all that again.Otherwise, I pretty much love the VX8300. Good product, thanks I\\'ve had the phone for about a month now and I\\'d say it\\'s really nothing to write home about. When the CPU usage is a little too high it starts to freeze up quite a bit. I can only use Instagram and Snapchat when most other applications are closed out and when you plug headphones in the volume is automatically throttled down to about %50 even when it says %100 and there\\'s no work around for this issue. I had to purchase a separate Bluetooth headphone adapter to get decent volumes. Other than that I guess for the price the phone will do in a pinch. great budget smart phone.The phone is plenty fast and screen resolution is fine for my uses. Dual sim so I tried it on both att and t-mobile at the same time without any problems at all, switching between sims took about ten seconds. Choice to store contacts on sim or on phone which is great if you need to keep them separated.HSPA+ gave me speed test averages around 3-4MPS download and 1-2 upload on both att and t-mobile, a little slower than 4G tests at the same time so if you were worried about the 3G spec, don\\'t.I find myself using the FM radio more and more often.Why waste money for specs that make no difference to you. Very good smartphone I payed the shipment to make it come on Thursday / Friday because I needed for the weekend and came on Monday. However, It wasn\\'t a big deal but the phone is in some language that I don\\'t understand, with other alphabet and the manual too. Is being really hard for me changing everything because IDK even the letters!!!! I\\'m getting crazy.Now I\\'m starting to worry abt if it will work in Argentina or not. Very good, working very well and I am happy with it. Still using this phone a year later.. I\\'ve had zero issues with it except I butt dial people ... I bought it like \"New\" but it is not. It is refurbished and it suddenly stopped working My son wanted a watch. So, I researched all over amazon\\'s choices. This watch seemed to be excellent. It came in, I didn\\'t even open it, just gave it to my son, excited. He\\'s 14 and a tech junkie. He took one look at it and tossed it aside. He\\'s about 6 feet tall and a big guy. So, it shocked me to hear him say that the watch was not for him. He said the watch face, itself, is much too huge, too thick, too big for him to wear. He didn\\'t like it so much that he disregarded any tech capabilities on it, altogether and wasn\\'t interested in it any further. He left on the table beside him and didn\\'t give it a second look even though I advised him all it could do. Nope, not even remotely interested because it was too big. I tried to attach a photo to show you why the thickness is an issue with him. I\\'ve still not used the item and the purchase was a long time ago. I\\'m keeping it though, hoping that one day, it will be useful to me. I\\'m thinking it may be useful for jogging purposes. But, I, really, can\\'t speak up on it. I haven\\'t used it. No one wants to wear such a thick faced watch. So, the technical features have not, yet, been experienced. So, if, I do take the time to find someone to use it, I will be sure to update you on that. The three stars is only that no one wants to wear it. I never write reviews, but I felt compelled to write one for this phone. I had the 1st edition Moto G prior to this one. I do like this phone a lot, but wish it was smaller like the 1st edition I traded up from. I am still trying to get used to the camera adjustment for low light. It\\'s a great feature, but if you need to take a picture quickly like I did, most likely the lighting will not be correct.I was also not able to find any cases for this phone locally and bought a case through Amazon that did not fit properly. Though returns were easy for the case, I was without one until a new case was shipped.I have Cricket Wireless service, which works well with this unlocked phone. Apparently this phone does have a slight glitch with photo messages from time to time according to Cricket where you will have to reset your APN to default for the pictures to complete downloading. Initially it worked, but after a few days usage somehow it would not allow the download. It was a simple fix, and I am hoping it will not happen often. Great customer service. Product arrived the exact day promised and it works so far. I haven\\'t really have time to use it, just test it with sim card, and as far as I can tell for now, it works This phone is just as the seller describe it, it works very well. Only complaint is, it does not have the volume that our old phone did. But of course this is not the sellers fault. it was what I thought it would be Good product at great price and no contract worries. good Love it. Work great with Tracfone carrier. El teléfono lo enviaron defectuoso, ya lo he mandado a reparar varias veces y no me ha servido para nada Junk Great Battery over heats 100% serious vender very recomended Product received as advertised, and fast shipping. Needs tweeking with the storage space, photo and video quality and it would be a 5star product. excellent The size for one it said 4.0 and it wasn\\'t also the volume goes in and out HELLO VERY good morning WRITE THEM IN ORDER TO TRACKING NUMBER requesting OF PHONE URGENT BLU SAMBA defective phone. It offers few solutions provider. bad buy. I would not buy no headphones, no charger but looks and works PERFECT. definitely worth it. so far i like it it has more than i expected when i travel with it and add the second sim i will be able to give a better review went to many stores and they could not tern the phone on they said it was european and cant be activated Excelent I ordered a blue 5c with 8 gigs, I got a beat up white 5c with 4 gigs. I\\'m thinking about returning it, but I can\\'t go without a phone for long and I\\'m not sure how long it\\'ll take for them to get me the right one. I\\'m bummed out. I absolutely love this phone, I\\'ve been using it about 6 months now and it has never crashed or anything. I love the s pen feature that allows me to take a quick note regardless of what screen I am on however I do not understand the purpose of the multi window. I find that rather annoying but you can always turn that off. I had a nexus 5 prior to this phone and it was a major upgrade. The size is something to get used to as it is a bit bigger than most phones but it\\'s the best cell phone I\\'ve ever had. Great I like my BLU X150Q. The only aspect to improve on my BLU is the Camera. I\\'m spoiled from my Nokia520 camera, the images in artificial light with my BLU do not look as nice as I\\'d like. I now have an issue with my BLU phone not accepting a charge and the operating system continues restarting throughout the day. Not good. Excellent product.It is a must to have for travelers.Really easy to setup and use. Received the phone quickly but it does not work. Will not hold a charge and won\\'t retrieve the contacts list. Compete waste of money. Avoid like the Ebola virus. This phone is so full of bugs and so badly designed it\\'s hell on a battery. Hard to know where to begin to tell you all the issues, suffice it to say caveat emptor! has problems taking photos or video outdoors screen resolution is terrible because the display is difficult to put very dark This KRZR K1 is very neat and small, and carries alot of features. The time and callers Phone number is seen on the outside of the phone when someone calls, so you can screen your calls. It\\'s trully a nice neat phone I\\'m one of those guys who hate to carry a whalet in my pocket, i only cared to carry my drivers license, insurance card and one credit card, now i can carry that along with my cellphone in a compact way. Great idea The phone was great at first. I just had to get used to a touchscreen phone. Then I thought the battery was dying on me. I bought a replacement battery and still had the same problem. It turned out that the screen would just go out. problem just got worse. LG is not my friend. Using it and enjoying it. Thanks! !!!!! I am extremely unhappy with this purchase...sound s***ty....I can\\'t hear thank you Yesss, I love itExactly wht I expected The phone not has good reception, has connection issues, I tested with two operators in Venezuela and malfunctions, do not go if your phone does not work here, I wonder a review of the seller, thank you.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I\\'m writing to let you know that the Lenovo S-850 , I just bought, it doesn\\'t work properly, because it is uncapable to get gsm signal.I Could realize that it has shown in the box, just one (1) IMEI number, and the serial number shown in the OS screen is 0000000.I bought a second GSM Dual Sim Lenovo S-850, and Works properly, in the same location and using the same GSM micro SIM CARD to test.I could realize too, that this second telephone, shows 2 IMEI numbers in the box…I attached some pictures, to be checked by you…I wonder how are you going to solve this…Really nice, but doesn\\'t work… I order one for my sister no problems, good solid phone, and then after seeing the phone my mom also decided she wanted one. I ordered it and at some point during the shipping before it entered the shipping packaging some idiot decided to open the phone\\'s box and play with it. The tape on the box itself was cut sticker was not on it the phone someone opened the screen protector it came with making it unusable and the decided to turn it on and adjust the brightness to where the screen cannot be seen making it impossible to see anything, and I cannot fix it. I hate UPS and the moron who decided to screw with it. Most likely asking for replacement, but complete waste of my time. good The phone worked at first perfectly fine but slowly started turning itself off randomly touch screen only works when It feels like it They phone was exactly as described Great phone was a gift for my mother and played around with it all day i come from the lg g2 and this phone is just right. at first i thought could be to big for my mother since she is a small women but it helps out being big makes typing and viewing so much better. any one that likes a big phone and fast should get this one. great price i love my phone alot i can put it down Awesome Does not do what I wanted out of a smart watch. Guess you get what you pay for. I would not buy again. Excellent product! It just came like brand new! A very well made smart phone. Easy to use. Although an older version (iPhones are now version 5), the manufacturer provides software updates. Bought this for my Daughters 14th Bday - she loves it! It has no noticeable defects, scratches etc. It looks like it\\'s brand new, not used or pre-opened. Was nervous it wouldn\\'t be as good as advertised - but it really was! Thank you for providing an affordable alternative - great product/service! These are decent phones. I have owned several. When they work like they should, they do a great job, but I have had a lot of problems with these used ones. It\\'s a hit or miss thing. You might get a good one or you might get a bad one. But even if you do get a good one, there is still some limitations. First they come with a boat load of crap ware from the manufacturer and AT&T that makes the phone sluggish right out of the box. Of course, they won\\'t let you uninstall any of it, but you can disable most of it. So you have to spend an hour or two disabling the 30 plus apps that you do not need or want. Then the phone works pretty good after that, and you have a little room to install some apps that you actually want, but not a whole bunch. If you install too many apps, the phone goes back to being sluggish again and gets to the point where it is barley usable. Then you have to go back and disable and uninstall anything you absolutely do not need. This is true of just about any android phone because of androids horrid memory management, but it is much more of a problem on these older phones with lower resorces. Came in terrible condition. Very dissatisfied. Will be returning Nice phone not too fast not too slow Please do not buy this product does not work I don\\'t love this phone for a couple of reasons which may not matter to others: 1) there is no user manual available - none came with it, none is available online, so while I am able to use it, I have no easy source to figure out a number of issues; 2) there is a known problem with the camera orientation, which is that some third-party apps, like my bank\\'s mobile app, are not compatible with the orientation of the camera. This is a PITA when trying to take pictures of checks for deposit. The solution suggested on number forums is for us - the users - to contact the developers of the third party apps and scold them for not updating the apps to keep up with this and perhaps other phone cameras. Not something I\\'m going to be doing. So despite having bought a case, a screen cover, and the adapters necessary to use all my chargers with this usb-c phone, I\\'m seriously thinking of returning it while I still can. Excellente device el equipo cumple contodas las especificaciones que se establecen en el articulo, muy buen equipo, recomendado a los usuarios de los mismos Wow! This is a great protective case! Love it! Very good phone works with all GSM networks in Venezuela, this product comes as such, access to BBM, WhatsApp and other basic applications described, no 3G Love it ! Love it ! & LOVE IT !😘😘😘😘😘❤❤❤💖💞💞💟💟👍👍👍💓💓💓💕It has finger scanner in the front ,really novel.Big & really nice cellphone.The only drawback is that it\\'s a bit slippery material，but i still love it!Texture feels good, nobleFast shipping,good seller. After only one month, the proximity sensor stopped working, that means, that when i started talking, the screen was not able to get blocked and made me miss a lot of calls, and also, it was the cause that the phone batery could not last more than a couple of hours. After, around five (05) months using the phone in those conditions, the htc one x Suddenly stopped working, what happened is that, without any reason, it lost the Imei code, after that, there was no way to make it work again. I could only use it with a wifi conection, as if it were a kind of tablet. A couple months later, the screen just stopped working at all... All This, in fewer words, was money sent to the waste can. I feel Angry and deceived. I will never again buy an htc product. Love my new iPhone case! I can carry my drivers license and credit card in the case without having to lug my purse in and out of the store. What\\'s nice is that it does not appear to have a compartment and looks like a normal \"high quality\" case. horrible did not work at all. Reviews of this phone everywhere on the internet says it all. #1 phone of 2015. There could be a little, just a little more color variety :) Besides that nothing else to say. The microphone is problematic and my voice is not audible to the person I called. Moreover I expected the D820 model as I am staying in Texas but I received the D821 model [rest of North America]. I ordered the s5 a couple weeks ago after my Galaxy III decided to kick the bucket, and I\\'m finding it to be an incredible improvement over the strengths the III originally had. Rather than go into detail over the phone\\'s features and beat a dead horse (CNET has a very comprehensive review you can read), I\\'ll discuss the \"buying experience.\"I purchased this phone from an Amazon Fulfilled vendor called \"The Wireless Circle\" (received it within 2 days via Prime!), It came delivered in a standard Amazon cardboard box and the phone itself in typical Samsung packaging, brand new, with a quick-start booklet, headphones, USB 3.0 cable, and a charging plug. The battery was already fully charged.I am an AT&T customer, but the website and the store were going to charge me $519 plus shipping, and no phones were available within a three-store radius where I live (Hah!). I did some online research and realized buying an unlocked phone was the way to go. I could write an essay on the differences between an unlocked and contract-free phone (just Google it) but if it helps - Since I am an AT&T customer, buying an unlocked AT&T phone meant all I needed to do was take it to the store for activation. Even then, all I needed to do when I got there was replace my SIM card.Ergo: I SAVED MONEY by purchasing an unlocked phone. No more 2-year contracts for me! This is how I\\'m buying my phones from now, on. Good, solid phone for the price. I bought two. Nice design by Apple. Worth the price. ok, so this was my very first iPhone, and I love it. It worked perfectly, and got to me in pristine condition. There was some confusion on how to unlock it, but the sellers gave amazing service and had a great attitude helping me out with it. I sent a lot of emails asking for help. All issues were resolved, and it works perfectly, even now. 3/11/14. Good watch, but battery life dies quickly and functionality could of had more features I bought this phone as a spare for a \"just in case\" situation. The performance is a little slower than what I\\'m accustomed to but it gets the job done. The price is excellent in addition to being unlocked, this is one of the best deals around. I still have the phone and no issues at all. Would definitely buy from this seller again. I loved my old HTC 8X. Inexpensive but powerful enough to do everything I needed to do (GPS, run multiple apps in the background, etc.). I bought this one mostly because it was also unlocked and in black. Turns out, though, Verizon does not allow you to change the MMS proxy servers, meaning, despite being unlocked for GSM bands, my AT&T plan is unable to make use of picture texts. I have read elsewhere that data is also unavailable for other carries, though I can\\'t confirm this.Basically a huge waste. Great phone, but get it from another carrier. I bought it on Vodaphone last time (still in black) and had no problems whatsoever. I bought it for my mom who lives in Europe. So far she is very happy with this phone. I was little bit concerned with the fact that you need to unlock the phone with american sim before using it with any other card. But the process went smoothly. After making a call with an american sim card I inserted european sim and it worked perfectly.I saw that some people had problems with seals. I didn\\'t have any issues, phone came in a brand new box with well attached seals. Also, I had no problems with phone being formatted to any specific language. Amazing phone, amazing features. Good phone to own. Very next to impossible for an expert at texting to get right. I hate this phone the lg3 is 5 star the lg2 is a 2 if not a 1 or zero. Explain: the space bar is not on the bottom center. When you type, for example \"I am going to the store\" it will come out like \"iiiii\" take a minute to erase all the extra i\\'s \"ammmmm\" take a minute to erase the extra m\\'s it\\'s just a pain so go with an envy3 I love my new phone! I was a little concerned about some of the reviews but I figured for the price I would take the risk. My phone looked brand new when it arrive. Came with a generic usb cable and charger. No headphones. Front camera does seem like it has less quality compared to my old 5s but the front one is the same. Everything works as expected. Súper excelente 100% cool!!!! Being an Iphone lover, I was bit apprehensive earlier to switch to Samsung for it\\'s hot selling product. After one week of using it, I have completely fallen for this one. It actually justifies of being the \\'latest\\' mobile gadget available in the market and it gives you every bit of it. Few points which make this one a must buy:SUPERB Gaming experience : I just couldn\\'t stop myself from downloading a couple of games and the playing experience has been fantastic.UNBEATABLE Camera : Just give a cluck shot and you will fall for this one.DOESN\\'T HANG UP: Yes you heard it right,Get ready for a flawless experience.MARVELLOUS looks: This device feels so sleek in hand, for those who want performance and looks, this one is certainly the best steal. Great phone. Great Price. Great Condition.Comes with a cheap looking charger, and not the original packaging. A+++++++++Goodshiping and as he sade like new. The most important that 4G is working fine in my area. That what i need.Thanks Its a Good Phone.!! I used this phone just sometimes since it wasnt for me, but in the time used it works awesome its really fast and the graphics are really good. It has all that you can expect, the hardware is better than others similar phones. It did what it was supposed to do Overall a great phone its not the most new note but it gets the job done the software update made it like a note 2 so overall I am happy with my debice Besides needing a extra sim card and a blue tooth head phone this watch works great. The price is great to a lot less then the $ 200.00 that the other guys are asking. Great Phone. Great Camera. The camera is awful. The images are not clear at all. The battery doesn\\'t last at all. Barely a day and a half. Really bad buy. Loved it phone works as advertised!! no complaints!!! i almost love it ... Go BLU fast and accurate service Phone slowly started not responding, not working - over a 3 day period. Got screen msg \"Unfortunately, Launcher 3 has stopped.\" Also got a flash msg so fast could not read it all : \"...com . android systems... .\" Then phone completely dead. Only six months old. Two repair shops could not fix it. Now in process to send it back to Blu... Love it , is in very good condition and very good working. Very fast shipping. delivery was spot on --phone performed just like the old one buen celular myuy buen precio y preciso en el tiempo que lo solicitñé gracias por ponerlo en venta lo recomiendo This phone works just fine and as described by the seller. There was not a scratch on it when I received it. I am very satisfied with this phone and would buy from this seller again. I LOVE THIS PHONE I just got it today and it is so smooth and elegant... I used to use Motorola, but this is a huge improvement... Nokia is amazingUpdate: it was working perfectly then died and never turned back on again. iPhone is shipping now :/ Excellent I was very happy with this purchase.The cost of the OtterBox Defender Case was much less then purchasing at a store.It is very durable and I feel my phone is well protected. The instructions were very clear that it came with. Great phone, work very well I find value for money for this phone. I was so hesitant to migrate to Samsung phone. Now am embroided in the brand. Excellent I had this phone before but unfortunately it did not make it through the wash. It is a basic phone with large numbers that are easy to use. Nothing fancy, but my favorite! Excellent,HTC is simply the best. Even when the phone is used and have a failure in the back camera The phone did not work very well, the build is way cheaper then it looks, i would not get this phone. Even years after its release this phone is still fast enough for just about anything you could throw at it. The 3GB of RAM is much needed for powerusers who love multitasking. I bought this as a replacement for my original Razr (that\\'s the one with the battery that lasts about 1 1/2 hours). This one has great battery life and I believe it operates better than my old one. everything is good Wouldn\\'t allow me to accept multimedia messages and people on the other end couldn\\'t hear me. Terrible.. Camera sticks.. Apps stick... Please don\\'t waste your money The product is good and meet my expectations. since I bought it I have not noticed any problem with it. I recommend it positively for use This is a nice looking phone, looks way better then my iPhone 6 Plus, work great too as expected from a Samsung product 👍 My speaker at the bottom is broken and there are some chips and dings that I wasn\\'t notified on but over all I love my new phone. Everything arrived fast and we\\'ll packaged. Watch does what I expect it to and is a fun little gadget. Device was not unlocked Per AT&T. It was time waste to order and then return. I am so pleased with this phone. I had been looking for one for weeks, but they were so expensive. Especially with the 32g that I wanted. It came in good time, in good condition. And I love it! Everything was as it should be. This is perfect phone for daily uses. Comfortable and very simple. The battery lasts for a long time. excellent This is a versatile basic phone. Although, it is not advanced in the \"IPhone\" tradition, it has it\\'s own usefulness. I\\'m still investigating it...... Wrong phone had to send it back A beautiful stable phone. This phone performs flawlessly with its sharp up-today\\'s Windows OS. I recommend it to anyone. It\\'s fun to see the tiles constantly jump. A true black screen that lets its tiles\\'s color stand-out. THIS PRODUCT IS VERY GOOD, AND I REALLY ENJOY USING IT......I WILL SPREAD THE GOOD NEWS TO SOME OF MY FRIENDS.... Got this for my son...so far he loves it!!!...it seems to do all it claims...he\\'s still figuring it out...only had it about five days. Mixed bag of pluses and minusesPros:+ Screen/image quality - I set mine at about 25% brightness for the most part and it\\'s still very clear and vibrant+ Audio - the Dolby hi-fi is great! I just moved from the HTC One M7 with Beats Audio and the ZTE is just as good. Crisp music. Less bass than the One.+ Camera - lots of customization. Focusing could be faster though. Dedicated camera shutter button (btw does not activate the camera though)+ Bloatware - not that many. The android os is pretty clean.+ 4GB RAM - no lagging yet+ High-class style - I have the blue one and the buttons have gold accents. Nice touch!Cons:- Processor - playing Hungry Shark for 20 minutes caused the back of the phone to be very hot- JBL earphones - very cheaply made. Not worth the $50 \"suggested retail price\" per ZTE\\'s website. My $10 skullcandy produced better sounds too- Button placement - I don\\'t like the power button where it is. Hard to press. I\\'m always pressing the volume button along with the power button- Storage capacity - 32GB but really about 24GB free to use for personal stuff- Body - the backing is not completely flush. Seems to be in three pieces and on mine the top left piece is not perfectly flush to the middle piece. Kind of shows the lack of 100% QC.Final thoughts:Specs on paper are amazing, truly a flagship competitor. However, value doesn\\'t hit a perfect score. Especially when you can find the brand name flagships at around this price point now. LG G4 for about $420-470 on eBay. Samsung S6 for about $500. Long term, I hope this phone will satisfy my needs and that the warranty will hold up.**** UPDATED 9/9/15 *****This phone is giving me too many issues:- not receiving any incoming calls (BIG issue)- screen rotation gets stuck sometimesI really wanted to like this phone but just too inconsistent. So it\\'s heading back to Amazon. Works as advertised and it is a great product for the disabled. GreatCall has the best customer service I have ever experienced. All features work great, the only thing that below my expectation is I can only get 2G data rate out of it.I believed it is 3G+ capable, but I never got 3G data, I have to switch back to my old phone with Windows Phone 6.5to get higher data rate. After reading a ton of reviews for budget smart watches I settled on this brand. Was easy to charge. Programming is difficult and. Took a few hours and YouTube videos to master...calling, texting and updates work....great starter piece...the fit was great for my bf but he has very large wrists. Face is large and he has no problems using his big hands during operation phone was great. seller shipped it quickly!The phone just bricked itself! manufacturering issue.[...]LG will replace it. I\\'m having them replace, buit it will be an ATT bloatware version :( and will take a week to replace great price, great phone, looks good and works perfectly,thanks. Nice very mediocre, the bluetooth range is garbage, a wireless speaker i have needs a 6 in range with this phone, where other phones are about 10 ft with no loss in quality. if you are using in the usa like i am, i learned it was either at&t or t-mobiles network only, i use straight talk and while compatible it is horrible in my area, so please check your service first for this technology before swapping to this phone. This is a fantastic phone, easy to handle size wise and the keyboard is large enough for me to work with as a senior. The features are very easy to use and the clarity is great. I have not yet added any more services but will soon. A GREAT phone! works great it protect the phone and all the good stuff. **SEE UPDATE BELOW**I\\'ve been using this phone for over 3 weeks now and I so glad I went with the Z5C.HARDWAREIt heats up a bit when doing heavy gaming or long video recordings, but not all too concerning...especially considering I don\\'t notice any heat during typical daily operation. I would say the battery is adequate but it wouldn\\'t be considered one of the strengths of this phone. I don\\'t imagine battery life gets any better with other phones unless you go bigger...which, why the hell would you be looking at this phone if you were willing to do that? Go with the Xperia Z5. That said, I haven\\'t experimented too much with \"stamina mode\" but if you use alternate messaging services / apps (like Google Voice) or music streaming apps, you\\'ll have to add those apps as exceptions to be able to use data when the screen is off...which will diminish the benefit of \"stamina mode\" and preclude you from using \"ultra stamina mode\" all together. This is my first Quick Charge 2.0 device and I\\'m very impressed with how much charge you can get out of having it plugged in a just a while (ie 10 minutes). Wireless charging would\\'ve been nice to have but I\\'ll gladly sacrifice that feature to get dual front facing speakers, expandable memory, and water resistance.Speaking of expandable memory. My buddy was playing with a camera-equipped drone his girlfriend got him for Christmas and was bummed he couldn\\'t get the videos off the micro SD card (he didn\\'t have an adapter). Everyone at the party (iPhone users) was blown away at how I was able to get and share the video by putting the micro SD card in my phone and using Google Drive to share it. I don\\'t know why we are letting phone manufacturers sucker us by buying phones without expandable memory.At 720p screen resolution / quality looks great to me. If reading small text is difficult or annoying or you plan on watching HD full-length movies on your phone, get a bigger phone. I have excellent eyesight and find this display great for watching YouTube videos or reading articles.I don\\'t take a lot of photos / videos but I\\'m pleased with the camera so far. You can find great camera comparisons online. From what I found this camera is great but Samsungs perform better in low-light and close up focusing...but the Z5C is a huge step up from my HTC One M7 when it comes to low light pictures.SOFTWAREI was a big fan of HTC\\'s Sense UI and didn\\'t know how I\\'d like Sony\\'s UI as this is my first smartphone from them. After downloading an HTC-like free clock / weather widget, I like the UI a lot. Screenshots and screen capture are particularly easy and fun. Still waiting for Android 6.0 Marshmallow update that was promised (see summary below).SUMMARYAs far as I know the perfect phone doesn\\'t exist but based on the other flagship phones available right now and my preference for water-resistance, expandable memory, and front facing speakers...I was prepared to give this phone a perfect 5 stars. I\\'m giving it 4 however because it would appear that Sony is following the lead of others by promising \"soon\" updates to the latest android version (6.0 Marshmallow) to help sell their new flagship phone but then making those of us who believed them and bought the phone wait around while the update is delayed. If the update comes prior to the new year I\\'ll adjust my review to 5 stars. Almost 3 months for an update seems like enough time to tailor Marshmallow to their UI...if it was a priority.**UPDATE**This is the worst phone I\\'ve ever had. On paper it\\'s great but I\\'ve never been so frustrated with lagging issue. I\\'ll get a phone call while its in my hand and I\\'ll mis the call because pushing \"answer\" is non-responsive. Killing apps helps a bit but I find myself restarting the phone a lot. I was hoping the Marshmellow update would help but its now March 8th & still no update. First & last time I buy a Sony phone. Since the Galaxy S7 is water resistant with expandable memory, I think I\\'ll get it if a softwarw update comes soon & fixes my problems. This phone is a smooth operator, plays games, runs my business software. I am so happy. And the price wasn\\'t terribly steep. excellent product timely delivery highly recommended excelent This phone was for my husband, the only thing I notices was his old phone has a flash, whereas this one didn\\'t. Very low capacity Love this phone. Highly underrated. Superfast lots of storage. Audio is great. Battery life not bad. It\\'s not that good excellent Nothing to say other than : go for it.The screen is good. The volume is extremely loud. The audio quality is very good. I don\\'t really play with the phone except using tetris. For email, Facebook and so on is amazing. The GB space is just perfect. It\\'s working alright. Shipping was delayed from China a few days. Bit phone works great. No problems at all works with straight talk by the wayMy daughter loves it screen is big and display is good but only one thing she has said sometimes you have trouble hearing when using itBut overall good buy good qualityAnd works great!!!! incredible phone! Since android 6.0 update battery does not last a full day, roughly 13-14 hours with little use, and worst of it all, the \"waterproof\" is virtually a lie, dropped in the sink, the second it touched the water, the phone immediately stopped working, now i\\'m out 500 dollars. It took several weeks to get it. They mailed it from China. Also, the clip is fixed, meaning that it doesn\\'t rotate to allow reorienting the phone on your belt. It is simple and basically functional. It was cheap, but the month-long wait was not foreseen. unable to connect my T-mobil phone service .It\\'s not 4g, it was 3g so far so good When talking on the phone sometime you cant hear what the person is saying, all i hear is noises. Other than that it very fast. excellent product thanks Don\\'t buy this cellphone from Logitech LLC, i tried to turn it on and didn\\'t work. I charged it for a couple of hours and i cound\\'t make it work. Also the screen was defective like if it was hit.This cellphone is neither original . I\\'m very happy with my purchase Was different,flashy and the talk of all my friends,Not expensive like the over rated \"galaxy\" cellphone watches! A real good choose. sent it back because it would not work with AT & T The galaxy S6 phone is very good but there\\'s one thing that really disappoints me. Sometimes the battery does not fully charge and I really don\\'t know why. Also, I think that the price is higher than it should be. The phone works well both in the US and internationally. One of my SIM cards is for phone company in Brazil and there is not problems. The only problem is that I cracked the lens so I guess I will have to buy another phone, but this time I will get a protective cover. The cost to repair the existing phone is more than I paid for the phone. I like the phone otherwise. I love iPhones! This phone is a great piece of technology. I recommend getting it. Love it Thank you for the wonderful phone. I was giving this phone as a gift and I really appreciate the great service It is a great phone as we have 2 already! However the quality & condition in the description of this phone were very misleading to say the least! It was in very poor condition and 3 different colors lol! And the opportunity system has been tampered with severely! Of importance, I have not yet contacted company to see what they would be willing to do or not. Just haven\\'t had time will hopefully update once I do. I throught the item was made bettrer then It look\\'s, the screen could be a little bigger then it is now. But I like the functions and the style the item. Excellent What the text doesn\\'t mention is that the phone I received was the world version, not the North American version. This meant that I would couldn\\'t take advantage of LTE speed and was stuck with 4G. Connects to iPhone in the most limited sense of the term. Does allow texting via device but you would really need a stylus to hit the tiny digital keys it provides. Most functions do not work as installed on device. Seems to be aimed at android devices. Instructions in poorly translated English. I got what I paid for, to put it simply. We bought this phone and it does work with the PTEL $20/mo plan that has 3G/4G just fine. The Phone is awesome, you just have to grab a ptel sim from ebay for 99cents to pop in it, we are VERY HAPPY to have an awesome up-to-date phone on a frugal priced plan. It is not charging not working Awesome good midrange smart phone with some features on the top of the line Didnt know it was a mini.. still 4 stars This phone is crap, I haven\\'t even used it because all it does is shut itself off and freezes.. I wouldn\\'t recommend it to anyone. Great phone, a bit smaller screen but very legible. I have GSM version on Straight Talk with ATT, very pleased. Pro: Supports wireless (QI) charging. CON: Non-removable back and battery. had one of thise for a year before it broke got another one great construction super durable and its deff water resistat muy bueno Love it! fast ,thin, light ,good looking and good size memory!!! 2 hours+ to set up. horrible. 100% recomendado very good Great price, great product! Brand new iPhone for a really good price! Bought this phone to replace 4S, but have had nothing but trouble. The camera only works toward the texter, not out the back the right way. My I tunes and computer do not recognize it at all. How do I get a refund? QUISIERA HACER PÚBLICA LA MÁS VIL ESTAFA DE LA CUAL HE SIDO VÍCTIMA POR PARTE DE ESTA GENTE (WIRELESS EXPERTS, INC), NO ES GENTE SERIA NI RESPONSABLE...LES COMENTO QUE RECIBÍ HACE 3 DÍAS EN VENEZUELA UN EQUIPO DE ESTOS, LO CUAL PODRÍA TRADUCIRSE EN QUE BOTE CASI 400$, YA QUE UNA VEZ RECIBIDO EL ARTÍCULO OFERTADO ME PERCATE QUE EL MISMO ESTABA BLOQUEADO (LOCKED) Y LO MÁS GRAVE AÚN, ES QUE PRESENTA UN PROBLEMA EN SU LECTORA DE TARJETA SIM, POR LO CUAL ARROJA AL ENCENDERSE UN MSJ DE ERROR DE INICIALIZACIÓN.

IS NOT RESPONSIBLE OR SERIOUS PEOPLE ... I must remark that I RECEIVED 3 DAYS AGO IN VENEZUELA A TEAM OF THESE, WHICH could translate into $ 400 BOAT ALMOST AS ONCE RECEIVED THE ITEM OFFERED THE SAME I realized that I WAS LOCKED (LOCKED) AND STILL THE MOST SERIOUS PROBLEM IN PRESENTING YOUR SIM CARD READER, SO TO CATCH FIRE THROWS A INITIALIZATION ERROR MSG.

CERTIFY THE E-MAIL AND I HAVE BEEN SAVED (THROUGH THE BACK AS IS OFFERED ME $ 50 FOR THE DAMAGES ARISE). It\\'s great!! Purchased 3 for business phones, 1 needed return and was replaced promptly, had an issue with handset mic no longer working after using the included earbuds. Replacement did not have the issue until about 2 months after owning, 1 has battery life issues to the point of being useless without a charger every few hours, and one seems to work OK but doesn\\'t see a lot of use. product is great, but i order it BLACK and it came BLUE.... =/ still good though I purchased it for $100 less than ATT store on Amazon and it is meeting up to my expectations. I like that it is water resistant. I have been a BB user for at least 5 years and have often owned the latest models mostly for business use. I purchased this one as a personal BB. Unfortunately, automatically I could tell it was not of the same quality as the others. It was much lighter and just felt flimsier. It also took a while to figure out how to download BB messenger which came pre-loaded in my past BBs. Perhaps that is standard, but it just seemed a bit odd to me that BB did not include BB messenger pre-loaded in its own devices... On the description it said this phone worked with straight talk service. It does not and my service said the phone is locked too. This watch does the bare bone basic of a smart watch. So if you need something flat out simple, it will do, but I bet you can find a cheaper one. Holding the watch now, I will admit it is ugly to look at, and the displays quality is low standard. What I honestly got this watch for was to change the face for a cosplay, but the device flat out lacks the ability to change it. Not only that, it uses its own POS of an app to connect it, unlike most watches that use Android Wear. After writing this review, I\\'m heading out to the UPS store to return it... After 6 weeks one day it need it to be charged, I put it to charge and went to check on it and it was extra hot. It never charge again and still getting hot. Waste of my money the seller said I only had 30 days garranty so I could not returned. I got this for my daughter that lives out of state she took it to a store that said it was not unlocked she took it to another store and they told her that kind of phone would work for calls overseas and would be touch and go for other calls.I\\'m not sure what all was said but she is not using . She said she would try another store but not right away I continue to have issues with connectivity with this phone. A list of the most common issues are:*Bar level is has never exceeded three bars, usually stands at two bars* Frequently cannot make calls --- shows \"Emergency Calls Only\" prompt*Frequently drops calls*Unable to connect with application for home security systemSince the vendor \"The Good Guys\" customer service online website does not allow a user outside of Australia to leave inquiries for customer support. I have contacted my cellular provider numerous times with the issues and they are unable to resolve or identify the issue. This is the second Samsung cell phone that I have purchased (previous one was an S4). I purchased the phone because of the reasonableness of the cost. I experienced service issues with both phones. When I select my cell phone it will definitely not be a Samsung or purchased via the internet. Works for 2 weeks and then breaks. Weird ads pop up and I hate it awesome Pretty good Worked well but the charge burnt up the charging port after a few months. Love it Cool product, great size, everything is great and work with movistar 3g and movilnet 3g in Venezuela Best case for children who have the iphone 5s. No worries if they drop it. Phone does not break and gives me peace of mind. Perfect! I got everything fast. The box was sealed, phone\\'s excellent! Love it!!! The condition was as shown! Very please. Love this phone a lottttt Great little phone just what I needed a non-smart phone with wifi. It is used on at&T with no data plan and photo turned off on the account can\\'t send photos because you would need the att internet services turned on to do this, so NO web service thru ATT, I just use HOT Spots or home networks for the web and email. the only service used thru att is phone and text. This phone does not have GPS tracking = Non-smart....1.Also has a built in FM receiver.2.Yes it has Bluetooth.3.It loads web pages Not like a Iphone it\\'s on the slower side but good enough for me.4.Good battery life.Hope this helps I am Android all the way and will never own one of these, but my daughter really wanted this and she loves it. Phone was in great condition. Works wonderfully. Great to have as a backup phone. amazing camera I have not received the product Blackberry Curve 3G 9300 Unlocked GSM SmartPhone with 2 MP Camera Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth - Unlocked Phone - International Version - Graphite Grey Excelllent The worst thing I ever purchased I need my money back, my cellphone works but all the applications I download like what\\'s app or viber dont\\'t work,when I turn the phone on it gives a java message.i am traveling nod not staying connected to my folks back home is devistating. Got to me quickly. Great phone. The iPhone does not work. My service provider could not activate it because it still had an account associated to the serial number of the phone. I purchased as refurbished. While the phone may work (I really don\\'t know because it can\\'t be activated. The seller has been contacted and has not contacted me to resolve the problem. Why? I don\\'t know other than they are not reputable, unprofessional, and could care less about their customers. Either way I would highly recommend Amazon remove them as a seller on their website. I am very disturbed and dissatisfied that I could be ignored as a customer and shown no respect about this issue. I will certainly pass this experience on to others, many others. I hope Amazon can lean on them to do what is right. A $330 rip-off is completely unacceptable for any so called, wanna be, legitimate company. I hope u can syndicate my feedback and get it to the right people! I order this for my cousin so far he likes it. I will do a update review if needed. Perfect phone... Got it for my 12 year old daughter. She loves it Exactly what I wanted I am so unhappy with my HTC Sensation. It takes forever to open the message board, forever to start the camera. Keeps on jamming, freezing, all after less than a week of owning it.I just don\\'t recommend this phone to anyone. phones are brand new factory? buy one a few days ago. I get the phone I do not agree with serial box. explain this. my phone provider said it might have trouble or stolen The camera is not all that good.. Love having this protection on my galaxy note 10.1. And the price could not have been better. I received this so fast. Love otter box ! Phone is great but having a hard time finding a case for the phone. Love this phone so much!!! love the phone i think we are missing out on the best quality ever the phone is superb and we need to sell more Having some issues with the phone. Voice quality is getting poor after every 4 mins. Replaced broken phone. All is well The phone works great its just that the bluetooth would kick me off a lot from my bluetooth headphones and my headphones have nfc and the phone would not work when i tried to pair the two using nfc I am very pleased with the product that I received, everything was in the box as promised and the device works great! its ok. for sure for kids or someone who wants to have a smartphone for the first time and has a very low budget excelente Mint condition and my wife absolutely loves it. Best phone ever! Great service and product! excelent great I am HTC fan. I am totally satisfied with the my phone. I don\\'t get impressed by I Phone or Samsung. HTC is a great quality phone. Very pleased. Excellent seller Well it is unlocked but does not connect to the internet. Hope it will someday. I did my best in connecting it to the internet ... Compré hace unpar de semanas este teléfono y me lo traje para Ecuador. Está funcionando perfectamente. No tuve que hacer ningún tipo de actualizaciones ni nada. Simplemente cambié mi GSM prendí el teléfono y a hablar. Buen producto. The phone itself and the speed with which I received the phone were great. The only issue I had was that, since it is a verizon phone, it could not send or receive picture messages under my plan (T-mobile). The ability to edit the APN for picture messages was locked, and therefore I decided to return it. I have since learned of an app for windows phone called \"Network Setup\" that directly fixes this problem on all Windows phones and have used it on my new windows phone. excelent Like the phone. Having a few minor problems and don\\'t know if it\\'s the phone or the operator. Yes I would recommend this product and the seller. Good This is the best phone I have owned. Very fast processing. Beautiful screen. Great tools for setting up the features and modes.I am not sure there is a better phone for this price. I basically plugged in my SIM card, a 64GB memory chip and charged the battery. It has worked flawlessly since then.I suggest that you let the phone completely discharge a couple of times. This will calibrate the battery life feature. My phone came with the screen was nasty with hand prints on it & the charger was broke. Not to mention 2 of my letters won\\'t work when I\\'m typing & the screen sometimes move up & down by iyself Broke in the first week. excellent product iPhone 6 Plus is great it\\'s five star 😄 color is not the same as picture Works really well in my area and it is a nice size compared to the bigger monster sized ones out now. Super nice phone. Especially great camera and display for the price. The PS4 remote play is cool too. i bought a blackberry bold 9790 from Good Guys Electronics the phone came in the original box and the phone with the usual wrapping of a new phone it was a refurbished phone advertised as new. LOVE THIS PHONE!!! It is the perfect size, cameras awesome, battery last all day. What more could a girl want?? Best value I\\'ve found in a phone of this type. Works without fail. I love love love this phone. Verizon no longer carries it and when my old twist broke I went to Nokia who directed me to amazon\\'s secure/preferred site. I did not want a smartphone, but I still wanted a \"cute\" phone that had great texting capabilities. I would def reccomend it! Basic phone that does works as advertised. Good reception.all over Europe, even in rural areas. Almost never our of range. Upgraded from from a 4s that met an unscheduled demise. Was pretty burned about it until my 5s showed up in the mail. If you keep your phone locked, the fingerprint ID alone is worth the upgrade. One touch and you\\'re in! Punching in a code every time you want to access your phone seems so archaic. All the other features are just icing on top. I\\'m one of those who is just not into this current fad of gargantuan cell phones just to have a big screen. I loved the size of the 4, and after having the 5 for awhile I think it\\'s the perfect size. Still easy to \"one-hand\" the phone and still easily slips into your front jeans pocket. I\\'m keeping the 5s for as long as I can keep it dry! Thicker than expected. Specs are not good as its price. Accessories boxes are bigger than its needed during shipping it moves a lot. It came with the camera flash not working. Actually I\\'min agreement with many other customers who score it with 5*. Everything about this phone I like. Even screen, which has less attractive resolution in reality looks perfect. Good connection with WiFi and 4G. Very decent battery life. Speedy. Worth it cost 100%. I\\'m a Cricket customer by the way. The phone was defective and would not read a SIMs card for any service that was tried. If I could get a phone that was not broken, I think that I would have been overly satisfied! great phone and very good service i give you 5 stars / i love this phone / thanks alot and very fast service and customer service was great thank you .Alexis A brand new Samsung Phone Focus as advertised. Took the sim card out of an old HTC, put it in the unlocked Focus and we\\'re back in business for a little over $100. Has more options and programs than I know what to do with even playing on the internet. Thanks Wireless Experts!!! Don Huber This phone looks like new and works perfectly. Just inserted the SIM card from my old phone, went through the easy setup prompts and done! I like the phone because it\\'s well made and reasonably priced. However I do not know how reliable it will be in the long run. Great iPhone 5s. Takes very decent pictures for such a tiny camera and lens. I like the HDR which helps even out the lighting. But, it still not as good as a dedicated digital camera, but still very convenient, and good enough to take good snap shots for posting online, which is a very convenient and smooth procedure. Screen looks good and does not scratch easily. So, I am very happy with it! Just to inform you that I received open box and 1 item is missing (BLU Energy X2 cell phone).Your assistance to this matter is greatly appreciated. Thank you once again and have a great day.. Description said it works for 4G but it didn\\'t work. It was 3G. Also first time I didn\\'t received the phone !! box only came with accessories, I had to back twice and finally got refunded. Nice phone just as expected As far as non smart phones go this one was pretty neat, good ringtones and what not. I believe you can add a memory card and download and play music. My mom doesn\\'t know how to do that so its perfect for her. Be careful when putting the back on, she bent one of the little plastic prongs and now it doesn\\'t close all the way. excellent, as expected The phone has a poor battery life, my headphones do not work with it. I need headphones that are specifically for this phone and the charger isn\\'t the universal. I am not happy with this product. Besides those things the pictures are really awesome, but that\\'s about it. Very user friendly, and quality durable case and high defination screen. Very comparable to an I-phone without the cost. Been using the phone for every day use and have not had any problems. Three months. Use the phone in high heat and humidity, and have not experienced any problems. The apps are good, speed, and the phone can stay charged for up to 4 days without charging with normal use. I am so rough on phones I do keep mine in a camera case due to lots of heavy bumpy items in my backpack. Sorry to hear about the poor customer service from BLU. I love this phone and many of my associates are amazed at the price and quality. In 1 month it doesn\\'t work anymore It works perfect in Argentina! My SD card does not work in the phone due to issue with the phone. Quick delivery and exactly as advertised. Use it mainly in Europe and works perfectly. I had trouble being heard in a croweded room of people chatting. Even turned up to max, we had to disconnect and put the radios up to our heads some of the time. i love the phone. everything was so quickly.Thanks I bought one HTC One X with this store, that one had problems with the simcard but this people changed the first one for another One X and in only two days they sent me another one, this has worked perfectly and it seems like new.This store is pretty serious, I recommended it to other friends who have bought more One X s, and everybody is very happy with the product. The smartphone really seems new. great phone. Have it with me constantly. Great reception/ no regrets. clearpictures. many free apps. easy to text. never regret purshase. I love my blu phone i didn\\'t find the camera resolution as great as they picture it. Great purchase! It was as good as new... Screen was immaculate and had no surface scratched. I\\'m very satisfied with my purchase. i like it I love it so much. i was a little scared when i saw the manual and the CD in some weird lanuage .. but i managed to switch it back to english. Not a high-end phone for the features it speaks of. really goes slow with everything. Whether it is changing song, changing profile, opening camera, browsing contacts .. but you get used to it.love the design, voice clarity, battery life. Beautiful case!!! Very happy with this PRODUCT!!! BlackBerry 8520 Unlocked Phone with 2 MP Camera, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi--International Version with No Warranty (Black)everything came well excellent all good excellent product. was received at the indicated time and without any difficulty, as based on the place of purchase. recommended one product Well I bought this phone in May 2013 now Jan,2014 .screen stop working properly. This is my second Droid 2 the first one screen just went black, you could still hear ring tone just couldn\\'t see how to answer. So I try another one and now different but still screen problem on the newest one.Doesn\\'t recognize touch. I HATE having to get another phone so soon. Good OK watch Great screen and decent old person phone :) easy to use I purchased my phone July 2015 it\\'s a ok phone my review is not about the phone but there customer service. Be aware that when you purchase this phone that there customer service is horrible. Beginning of October I had issues with my Sd and Sims slot not reading. I contacted Alcatel concerning the problem and was told I would have to send my phone in to be repaired for 15 days. When I asked why so long and I quote their customer service person said \" I sent you the email so do what you want\". I complained on Twitter the Alcatel company contacted me about the problem saying they needed more information it\\'s been a week still have not spoken to anyone or gotten help with this problem. Horrible customer service horrible phone. I guess you pay for what you get! 😫👎🏽😡😡😡😡😡. Final verdict all Alcatel could for me was offer me a free shipping label. If you purchase this product and it breaks you have to send it in to there repair center. They did not offer to replace the phone or even send a refurbish phone. Phone in the garbage like there company is garbage. I would not buy this phone. I LOVE my new blackberry!! I have always loved blackberry\\'s and I was needing a new phone but I wanted something different from the iPhone. I just popped my sim card in there and it went to work! The only thing is all the directions were in spanish haha but the CD it came with had the catalog in english and everything so it was fine! So far so good for me, I love my phone. I was so excited to be part of the new \\'touch\\' technology until I used it. This particular model does truly EAT battery time like it hasn\\'t been fed in years. It didn\\'t help that I received the phone w/a battery that expires in 2/2014! My husband bought the same phone and his battery\\'s expiration was 6/2017! Which explains why my phone kept shutting down and had difficulty re-booting. I\\'m thinking of investing in a backup charger with a second battery for those days when I\\'m very busy on this phone. I don\\'t make a lot of calls, it more like my \\'second\\' brain.I\\'m disabled and I need to keep more info (reminders, alarms, memos, etc.) than your average user. So Blackberry is really the only true cell phone that can handle my needs.At first I thought it was the phone that was dying, then I switched batteries with my husband\\'s cell phone and my phone worked and his stopped! That\\'s when I looked at the \"Expiration Date\" on the battery, only to discover the big \\'expiration time\\' discrepancy (purchased from the same seller). So, be sure to check the date on your battery BEFORE you start switching phones. My husband had to go buy a new battery ($60) just so I could be kept informed on critical information. (I\\'ll leave a comment on the seller\\'s site about this issue.)Blackberry is truly a great cell phone manufacturer and I\\'ve owned several models for the last 10+ years. Having a Desktop App that sync\\'s with Outlook is fantastic and the BACK UP capability is the major reason for getting a Blackberry..., especially if you have a lot of info and need to set multiple alarms, events, reminders, memos, tasks, etc. No other cell phone manufacturer provides this kind of backup/sync capability..., nor do they allow for multiple alarms, etc. (unless you want to pay $400 and up!).I originally gave Blackberry a \"2 Star Rating\" not just because of the items mentioned above but more importantly because I thought Blackberry was dragging their feet in supporting their full features in the \"Pre-Paid\" cellular market. All of my previous Blackberry cell phones had been through one of the top wireless carriers and Blackberry supports all it\\'s features if you have a \"Post-Paid\" account.Since we hardly used the wireless carriers\\' lowest package terms, we decided to save 50% and go with the same Wireless provider\\'s Pre-Paid department. Blackberry doesn\\'t want to support \"Pre-Paid\" customers. In fact, they won\\'t support your cell phone unless you are a \"Post-Paid\" wireless customer! If you need support, expect to pay hundreds of dollars and even then..., Blackberry refuses to allow their best features to work as seamlessly as they do in the \"Post-Paid\" arena. I\\'m a very loyal Blackberry customer and I am hoping that Blackberry will step up and be the professional company they have been in the past.Well, I figured out why ALL of this phone\\'s functions/features won\\'t work and I owe a HUGE APOLOGY to Blackberry. It\\'s AT&T that\\'s blocking this phone from being able to use all the features! Yes. AT&T! If you want this phone to work 100% then you have to get it thru AT&T in a \"Post-Paid\" environment. However, we bought this unlocked phone and activated it through AT&T\\'s GO PHONE \"Pre-Paid\" environment and after all this time of AT&T telling me it was Blackberry\\'s fault, come to find out..., AT&T is making a CHOICE NOT TO OFFER ALL FEATURES OF BLACKBERRY CELL PHONES IN THEIR \\'PRE-PAID\\' ACCOUNTS! Not only will they not support ALL features, but AT&T LIED TO ME for weeks saying it was Blackberry\\'s fault. I\\'ve been able to talk to Blackberry Suppoort extensively only to discover they OFFER ALL FEATURES!AT&T has REFUSED to contact me to discuss this issue! I\\'ve escalated to \"management\"..., only to get their big corporate \"run-around\"!AT&T apparently doesn\\'t really want to support SmartPhones. I\\'ve now wasted 5 weeks and I have a fantastic phone that is only capable of half of it\\'s features because AT&T WON\\'T SUPPORT BLACKBERRY SMARTPHONES!I guess I\\'ll just have to keep harassing AT&T until this \"Step Up\" and be the company they say they are!UPDATE:It\\'s been a few days now and I now seem to have a more serious problem with the phone. It\\'s set to automatically turn off at night and turn on before I awaken. However, this past week, I\\'ve been awake before the phone turns on and I\\'ve noticed that a few times, it goes through the \\'RE-BOOT\\' process before turning on! This is not normal..., it doesn\\'t happen to my husband\\'s Torch 9810. I orginally asked Amazon to take the phone back, then changed my mind as the Battery was DEFECTIVE. Now, it seems the DEFECTIVE BATTERY wasn\\'t the only thing \"DEFECTIVE\". I\\'m in the midst of contacting Amazon to see how to work out a return for a DEFECTIVE phone after 30 days. Wish me luck.Bottom Line: I still like the Torch 9810 and will get a new one..., one way or another! I don\\'t think I\\'ll buy from same buyer though (GMDS-Wireless). Great phone. works very well. Is exactly as described. tested it in the water and it still work! Great buy to used in the usa is horrible... Phone been plagued with problems just after couple months of using it....Blanking out, sticking, keys not functioning.I opened the phone and the amount of dirt in the phone could grow crops. I guess that is what you get for being cheap. slaw. good The phone is exactly what my husband wanted, only the screen is a little darker than his last phone that was the same kind. Overall phone is in good condition and works great! My husband does not want to upgrade to the newer kind of phones! This is a great little phone. Weighs under 2 oz on my postal scale. One star off for the recessed charging port that others have mentioned (had to take a utility knife to the case). Going back to Kitkat is a bit weird, but everything works great. I got this as a second phone to take running without weighing me down. Switching sim cards takes a bit, but not too bad. Too small for me to use as an everyday phone. Would buy this brand again. All in all a great deal. nice cannot activate best iPhone yet Horrible . This was the worst iPhone I\\'ve ever bought . I couldn\\'t even connect to MY wifi in the set up . Total waste of money ! The screen was shattered and I couldn\\'t even get past the set up . Don\\'t waste your time with this seller ! Just buy an iPhone 5s at Walmart on Straighttalk for $199 ! DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!! No matter what the good reviews say don\\'t take your chances! Constantly freezes even when no apps are running and all I do is swipe to unlock the screen! You get what you pay for and its not good! I dont even spend alot of time or effort on my phone and I still cant stand it. Freezes for minutes at a time and even getting it to the point to restart is a major pain. SONY is awesome. Great phone for the price. I purchased this phone and use the ptel mobile MVNO for service. I couldn\\'t be happier. This phone rivals all of its competitors but for a reasonable price. The screen is the perfect size and fits in my pocket with ease. The picture is brilliant too. I prefer the android environment to iOS and this phone has proven to be a great addition to my environment. Highly recommend. Bluetooth will not connect to my wireless earphones. It also not as receptive as my old Note 2 to my T mobile network. Shows only 1 bar or less where my note 2 used to show 4. I hve never seen a 4 bar reception on this phone. excelent Great phone, I\\'ve had zero problems with it. I\\'ve had a fancier, more expensive Samsung phone and found that BLU works just as well, is better prices and comes if more fun colors. :) Overall this phone is not for me. It has a few great features though. Way to expensive for what you get.It is too small for me and I don\\'t like not being able to delete the apps I do not use.I suggest watching the videos on youtube before you buy one. i sent it back!!!! Phone is great. I like better than. $650.00 phones by others. I got this as a trial watch before i get an expensive smart watch to see how much use i would get out of it and I\\'m pleased with the product, for the price it works well with my GALAXY S6 it delivers as posted i can and do answer BOTH phone calls and texts with the watch without pulling out my s6 i am content with it and think that soon i will buy a more pricey watch and use this one as a backup. I bought this item early September 2012, been using it ever since. I love the functionality, the look and the keyboard is nice and big! The random shut off problem is super easily fixed (search youtube!) and is due to the fact the battery is built as one back piece. The only major concern I have with this phone is battery life, mine cant seem to stay charged, but that might be just be the reality of having an older phone.. :/I would recommend this phone to anyone looking for a cheaper replacement that feels like nicer quality.Cute, great basic phone for the text savvy! The phone came in great condition, it looks brand new even though it\\'s refurbished. The only problem is the battery that came with it will only work while the phone is plugged into the charger. I wonder if this company will replace it since it\\'s refurbished? Great phone, bad battery. Luckily I have an extra one since I have owned this phone before. Hopefully it lasts since I had that phone for 5 years. If they fixed this problem I would give it 5 stars Ítem was sent with funny non standard power adapter and additional huge plug adapter. Completely unaccetable!. Please resend standard power adapter with corresponding return prepaid box. Samsung has made an absolutely Spectacular Phone with the Galaxy S7 Edge. Perfect Size; fits and feels well in the hand. Easy to use, the touch screen is brilliant, easy to see even outdoors, clear and crisp and the special edge feature of the screen makes this the most beautiful cell phone ever made. And that is just the beginning.The Camera in the New Galaxy S7 rivals many of the cameras you can buy for hundreds and hundreds of dollars! You can take Incredible photos in low light, great videos, even HD Video recording and much more. Removable Storage has come back with the Galaxy S7 and now you can insert micro SD cards with as much as 200GB of storage.You pay for high quality and the Galaxy 7 isn\\'t cheap. But it is well worth it. BUY The New Galaxy S7 - you won\\'t be disappointed. Its a piece of junk. Inclusive the watch damage my cell. This phone is amazing and has so many features that I dont think i will be able to use them all until the newer model comes out.Where to start, when you have a near perfect phone!?1. Screen is the best i have seen. 5,7 inches Quad HD with an amazing brightness just bring videos and pics to life. Plus reading the news or even books in this screen is really easy.2. Camera is also the best i have used so far. Wide angle shots, screen editing etc.3. Heart rate monitor and UV monitor.4. Battery life is AMAZING for a phone with this screen and resolution size.5. The pen! What can I say about the pen!! It is amazing, i find myself using the pen a lot more ofter than the keyboard. It has a very high accuracy level for writing or even editing pics plus another array of functions that are really cool.6. Design: leather back with aluminum vessel. This phone looks really sexy.7. Lightning fastThe bad:1. Phone has tons of options, but you have to take your time to dig into them. so if you are not really into this sort of things, I would recommend a phone that is more simple like the LG G3.2. It is a big phone! If you don\\'t have big pockets or a purse to carry it around you may not like it.3. No customizable keyboard.Overall this is the best phone i have ever had. It is so FAST, the screen is so neat, the camera makes my pics look pro, the pen is amazing for work and for play, and the design is really nice (i would still say that iphone 6 design is a little nicer). I really recommend this product. I used it for about 2 weeks, it was working fine and I was even surprised to see all the things that I could do with it...honestly I would take this over an apple iwatch. I forgot to remove one morning and took shower with it, I don\\'t if that\\'s the problem but now it won\\'t charge so now I don\\'t have a watch I purchased this phone for my 86 Aunt because she couldn\\'t see the buttons on that little Virgin mobile phone... she couldn\\'t make calls or answer them...So NOW the whole family is a lot more happier with her New JITTERBUG Purchases for business trip to Philippines and it worked fine without a problem. Also used to Lycatel prepaid service for someone who visited in US for few months. This support only 3G, but you may not feel the big difference from 4G anyway. This can be good for back up on business trips for other countries oitside of USA. Very good for what i paid for. Excelente Great very good product Never again, this phone will sometimes not connect to WiFi and has to be turned off to charge. it does not come with some of the promised features. if this is the only phone you can afford at the time you may just want to get a cheap Walmart phone. My 5140i is 8 years old. Still works, the battery still last about 7 days. But the cover totally desintegrated and the chinese aftermarket covers I was able to find don\\'t last a month (the flip out rubber cover at the base the protects the ports falls off within days). So, since I am no fan of smart phones, and frankly there is no other rugged phone (with termometer, compass, flashlight, noise meter) that is available in Europe I was amazed to see the new 5140s on Amazon.The delivery was prompt, I got it in 4 days.The product however is a nothing short of dissappointment. The \"original\" is made in Hungary, in an official Nokia factory (no longer exists I think), this one on the other hand came from Hong Kong. Made in China. The batteries, also chinese (two included) last for 2 days (and because the quality of assembly is dismal it doest fit properly), the bottom half (for some reson the keys have latin and hebrew letters too) of the case doesn\\'t attach to the top half (which by the way doesn\\'t have the level to help calibrate the compass).My rating is 3/5, mainly because I want to give it a shot, see how long it will last. So it\\'s based on my love for the brand and the original product. If I was new to this particular phone I would have given it 2 stars out of 5.The op system is slightly updated but no longer has the Polar Fitness watch support. Fast shipping. Phone at great price for unlocked phon that is 4G capable. it was a gift, she loves it Great phone great device Good price, excellent camera of 5 MP, good audio.One of the best 3G I have ever see.Default mini SD of 512 MBHigh recommended.The only issue to be aware is his size, everything else is ok. Perfect God bless you It is great, runs well hold all my music, camera is great, got apple care plus for two years! All the features of a iPhone 6 without the bulky size At first, everything was okay. all apps ran smoothly. The camera was perfect to take a self file or an view picture.But after using 5 months, This phone sometimes shut down immediately although I do not restart or using any strange apps. I reset phone and erased everything, this fault have still repeated.I bought it when I was in usa. Now, I comeback to my hometown. What should I do now? I\\'m so worry. Let me just say I am loving this phone, I have only had it for 2 weeks and I am learning something new everyday. I really liked my Galaxy s3 mini too, but Straight Talk now has 4g LTE in my area and I wanted a phone that also had 4g. This is a great little phone, it is a little bit taller and a little narrower than the s3 mini, but when I put it in the case I can\\'t really tell. It does seem a little faster than my s3 mini. I have gotten two days out of the battery, but I am not a heavy phone user. I play a few games like bejeweled, a little bit of texting, checking email, as an alarm clock and making phone calls. I very rarely use it to surf the web or watch videos. I am probably not the most techy person, but I have to say for my purposes this is a great phone and I would recommend it to anyone who does not want a huge phone, but still likes to have the quality of one. It did come unlocked and sealed, although like someone else it looked to have been opened and then resealed with an official seal. My guess is that SHOPBEST opened it to put in the plug adapter in it, so I could use it in the US without an issue. This is an inter national phone so the plug comes as a 220v and you need to put a converter on it for 110v. This is the mini version not the regular version. I knew all that coming in so be prepared if you don\\'t read the product description to be surprised. phone works just fine, just don\\'t drop it from any, and i mean any, height without a protective cover on it first. Dropped mine from 1 foot on to tile and the case cracked apart at the front and back seam. Im having trouble linking my texts to the phone. And I guess thats just user error. did not send the product being sent a completely different asked as we proceed in this case? sent another model This watch is junk, syncing is a pain and the pedometer is way off, and will not sync with my phone. You are better off spending the extra money and getting one that is higher quality this phone is everything I expected it to be & much more. I am using a 64 gig card with no problems at all. The KitKat upgrade went with no hitches. The phone responds beautifully at all times. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my new phone...Thanks BLU!!!! got phone in time, condition is OK, sides have minor and medium scratches, the front panel was replaced (something stuck under the front camera glass, its visible and annoying, since I see it all the time, but camera works fine).So far everything else works. Nothing but good things to say. Well designed product. Great customer service. Battery does not last long before it need to be recharge and there is no warning before the system shut off completely. Beautiful and compact, this sweet blackberry is my young sisters best friend, I bought it for her and I have been her favorite brother ever since. Its absolutely one you wanna try out. Its user friendly and easy to store. Just a reminder, the one I have is sim card free, so it can work better within the US and maybe Canada or Europe. Its a great phone... Amazing camera!!! Good phone!!! I love it so much~ Had to return to unforeseen blockage of the phones imei. Not Google\\'s best..but works good as an entry level phone. It can be glitchy and the storage is awful. Works good for people looking for a basic phone. Nice phone. I bought it from Venezuela and works with every phone company. Everything good My mom loved it. Brand new, works great, couldn\\'t ask for better 😃 OK I didn\\'t wanna post any review within a few days of my possession to avoid looking like snap judgment. So I had this phone for about a month now and I gotta say I\\'m very pleased with it. The display is so beautiful and the clarity is high. Even on low brightness. I thought the screen might be too small for me but it\\'s perfect. I have small hands myself. Now I don\\'t have to stretch my thumb across the screen to text messages. I can text comfortably with one hand. The battery life is just AWESOME!!!! Coming from a MOTO X that could barely last one day, I was afraid the battery life won\\'t be as good for this phone. And I was so wrong. I can easily use this device for two and half days straight without charging it. That includes internet browsing, data using, video and music usage, picture taking and basic calling/texting. Remember still turn off your phone once awhile, it\\'s like a computer, it needs to rest sometime. Anyhow, the only thing that is not too great about this phone is the camera. Don\\'t get me wrong. It takes great and clear pictures. I like the feature that you can choose what to focus when there are multiple things in one frame. The shutter speed sucks. It takes a few seconds for a photo to take a photo. That was pretty disappointing. I did insert a SD card later on and it did help with the speed a little but not too much. But out of all the good things about this phone, I can let one slide. Nothing is perfect right? excelente It is my big mistake to buy it.It works well in the first month. Then it started to become slow.The touch screen stops to work frequently. I have to reboot it all the time.Don\\'t buy it. Some some As described For the price this phone is hard to beat. Excelente l Love the watch, it does everything it was supposed to do.There is one problem with mine and that is I have to hold thepower button down sometimes to get it to turn on, and no itdoesn\\'t start up all over again, it just shows the watch partwhen it finally turns on.Aside from that it works great. PIECE OF S*** PHONE! I waited 6 months to activate - switched to Verizon from T-Mobile after 15 years of service - and the phone will NOT work NO signal... REALLY!? I have 4 young sons that I need to keep in contact with at all time! Doctors, hospitals, appointments! If I could cram this phone up someone\\'s ASS I would! This phone is locked by AT&T. The phone is only partially unlocked by AT&T, therefore you can use the phone on other networks BUT you cannot use DATA plans on other networks.Side issue: the seller (Joycells) is also very slow in responding. Sometimes it would take weeks (with reminders) to get a response.Technical details:When you set up data on a phone, the APN (Access Point Names) need to be changed. In the operating system on the phone, AT&T has blocked the APN from being changed so you cannot change to a different APN (from a new provider).In older versions of the Android system, you could run an application that modifies the APN and bypass this lock. Unfortunately, Android (Google) decided to team up with the cell networks and block this option in newer versions of the operating system (like the one pre-installed on the phone), so you cannot unblock the APN.At least for the foreseeable future (until Google stops the nonsense), the only way to use this phone with data on a non-AT&T network is to \"root\" the phone. Rooting the phone has advantages, but you lose the warranty from Samsung and the ability to upgrade with Kies.It is a good phone, but get it only if you plan to use it on AT&T or to root it. Thanks ! got to me on time and met my expectations ! Love this phone!!!!!!!!!! It is amazing everything about the phone is perfect Description was accurate. I received what i expected. Phone works great. I bought the phone thinking it was original and began to fail next month, will not work multitasking key and home , nor receive calls . I took it for service and was told that the phone is refurbished and it have software problems, it not accept reinstall software excelente Product came with damage to the bottom left of screen which was hard to notice at first so check it over well. I missed return window Great device. Get this variant of the Note 4 if you want it on U.S. GSM carriers such as Straight Talk, AT&T, T-Mobile, etc. LTE is available with this variant as well. The charger that comes with the device is not for the U.S., but seller did include adapter. The product is gr8. Thanks Excellent for the price The phone was not unlocked, 4 years later after i bought the phone, i still can\\'t use it. Message \" Restricted Phone\" Very Good This is a first for me. I have never written a negative review in my life, however this begs to be the exception. First of all, this appears to be a phone aimed primarily at the Caribbean market. The primary language is Spanish on both the box and instructions. There is also an English translation.I did note when researching the phone that there was a video review that noted the back cover was virtually impossible to remove. I have had a number of phones with removable battery covers, but never like this one. After trying a half hour with no success, I decided to return it. I was concerned that further attempts to pry it off would damage it and render it nonreturnable. The device is very small and very cheaply made I have been a Nokia admirer and user for years and I cannot believe this is a product of theirs - or Microsoft. My advice is stay away even at this modest price. It\\'s a perfect example of getting what you pay for - in this case not even that. The camera takes fuzzy pictures but otherwise the phone is fine. It was very clean, like new, as advertised but what is with that camera. I bought this phone several months ago and I want to review this item because it is worth buying it.Pors: I really love this phone, it stands all my multiple tasking craziness like a hero. It is fast, all applications run smoothly and quickly. The battery is really durable even when browsing youtube, netflix, etc and it recharges in a short time back to 100%. The battery charger is great quality too, and is the preferd one for everybody in the house because is is firm and you are sure it is charging your phone every time you plug it in. I use it in Argentina and it runs perfectly with my local carrier.It also inclueded gorilla glass, extra protection shell (golden, I love it too) and it fell to ground many times already (mother of three spirited boys will understand why) and it doesn\\'t even have a scratch!Camera quality is good enough and frontal camera is a good extra option for online chats, it includes many editing and selfie options which I don\\'t use but you may like them too.Cons: the memory runs out quite quickly, but I added an external sim card and that problem was gone.I really think this is an amazing phone for the price. I would recommend this item to my friends... actually I already did! delivered in combinad ! thank you This phone is great! In almost new condition! really is indestructible! Bought this for my dad and he loves it! better price than verizon was going to give me! I bought a new article. The article\\'s descrpticion is \"NEW\" and the item is refurbished. Prices are differente when the item is new or refurbished. I want my money back. The money need to be refund. I am waiting for you answer... I read a lot of reviews (both good and bad) on this phone before I purchased mine. I must say, either my phone was a fluke because everything worked great out of the box, or there are a lot of people out there looking to spend $100 and get a $500 phone! This phone is easy to navigate and set up, has a nice touch screen (I love the included hidden stylus!), and has a lot of features some higher priced phones didn\\'t. The pics and video are exactly as listed - this is a phone, NOT an SLR camera. The pics seemed perfectly acceptable to me as it is listed as a 3MP camera. Also, I read a lot about the quality of the mp3 player..??!! It\\'s a phone first and foremost. The sound quality to me is equal to my son\\'s Ipod touch using the same earbuds. Bottom line for me is that this phone cost less than $100, everything works just fine for me (MMS and data using T-Mobile), and the added features rival that of higher priced phones of the same age. I need the Samsung Galaxy S5 just delivered to my wife now in English Language pls, or get it replaced or returned to you. great buy Considering the price, it\\'s a very nice buy. Exelente all ok 10/10 The item came in Korean...not very cool at all. It took me hours to get the English version to update for use. So not cool. It works, though, it came with livable but annoying touch screen issues. The top half inch of screen doesn\\'t always register my finger. If you really want a phone like a blackberry, but without having to spend an extra 20 bucks a month for BBM, this is a great phone!My only gripe is with Amazon who lowered the price on this phone by 15 dollars, an HOUR after I recieved it. Not cool Amazon, not cool. It\\'s amazing it actually looks like a brand new phone and I received it super early 😄👍 I highly recommend it to others I have had many different phones, and this one is comparable at a heck of a lot less of a pricetag. I like the dual sim feature, though it is a bit odd that the sim card slots are two different sizes. All in all I am very happy with my purchase. Nice phone, but the camera has poor pic quality Good loking phone so ive had my phone since about 1/28/16 and its been working flawlessly! i purchased it with a case and screen protector and still no a scratch. camera has the best quality of any phone ive ever had; audio is crisp and clear. the edge is in all honesty unnecessary but fun to use. you can use it for contacts, speed dial(call text or email), news and many other notifications. if you rub the side a certain way it will tell the time without turning on the entire back light. (good for night time use).my carrier is cricket. i simply bought a sim also from amazon and set it up myself to avoid paying $25 for a $5 job. i usually have 4g signal probably because cricket uses at&t towers. overall this phone is a+ phone Nice for the price but earphone jack stopped working within a month Great phone It is nice Product ok, delivered in time. The phone it is not international unlockedYou can only used as phone the Internet part is not open. I do not get 4G or 3g on any Internet from my server ATT AAA+++ Nice Are amazing!!! The phone i recd WAS NOT DUAL SIM. It had a plastic cover where the second sim slot would be. Under the cover there was no sim slot. Otherwise i cant review the quality of this phone, but under the images of a google search you will find a few of these single sim versions. It\\'s a Samsung so im guessing it is a great phone, just be aware some versions are NOT DUAL SIM. IT DOESNT WORK FOR NOTHING Did not perform as expected. Low quality display. I would stick with the lumia products as this one needs much improvement to even come close. Not to mention you can get one almost as cheap (i.e. 520, 530, and 640) no samsung pay! I\\'m so happy with my cell It is so good great The old adage \"... you get what you pay for...\" seems to be appropriate here. I returned phone to seller because the screen was not seated flush in the case and actually moves up and down when lightly pressed. Got another phone from the seller, same problem. Seller says (after I asked) that all their Exhibit models are like this. Since this is supposedly a \"new phone\" I did not expect this kind of flaw. After about two weeks of going back and forth, I gave up, it wasn\\'t worth it the energy being spent. In addition, the screen just goes black/blank for several seconds before getting to its destination. Battery life is awful (even with no apps running). Major delays moving from task to task. Adjusted settings so screen would stay on during calls, but it still goes blank. Phone get very hot on just a single, 20-minute call. Volume on calls not good at all. I\\'ve always been please with Samsung products, but this time, not so much. I was in a rush to get a phone because my old Samsung died. Should have taken my time and spent a little more money. Great phone! Delivered as promised! How you doing dudes? just wanted to quickly share, got my phone, in less than 10 minutes I synched, email, contacts, calendar and heck it works really well here in México, so you know, most of the carriers in México are GSM, cool stuff, came in a box with all the safety stickers, great phone, perfect size... for the size of my hand I think Good Very smooth operation. Excellent battery life!Remains untested internationally but seems to do an OK job! Excellent Watch at that price! Perfectly fits my wrist, good design.Connect to Iphone 6s smoothly to sync calls, very surprised for the clear sound quality. Need more time to check more functions.Spend a little more time to connect to Samsung Galaxy, this watch has much more functions for Android OS phones but needs to download their APK file and install, it costs more time but made me surprised it can control my Samsung Galaxy\\'s camera.Not tested each function but this watch is really great at that price. 5 star! This phone is great if you want an Android phone that\\'s not too expensive. Excellent phone: light-weight, small enough to put in a pocket even while in a sleeve, superb contrast in display, great battery life, sound quality, and fast processor. Also, Samsung has used its top-of-the-line camera in the phone. It is not designed for heavy gaming, video or music work. My only reservation is that the phone is so new in the U.S. that Verizon (my first choice) was unable to activate it. Samsung hoped to release it last spring to general public, but as of 10/16, they have not done so. On a friend\\'s recommendation, I went to T-Mobile for service They easily made it work. Even then, they had to go to their tech support to find a way to set up voice mail. Within a day, a tech rep was able to send me a sofware patch that made that function work. Warning to potential buyers: My phone came from Amazon. You must buy a phone that can work in the American networks. If a phone is advertised as \"international\" model, (Sweden and Great Britain have had it available for at least 6 months) be sure you have a guarantee that will take it back if it doesn\\'t work. It\\'s ok Poor camera and screen display I have a lot of issues with the phone blocking out on me like right after when I can return the phone, but I\\'m stuck with it and a lot of my apps load very slow. The selphone is super nice ,my daugter love\\'t was her drimss, to have A\\' 5s ,i do loke forwer to buying in other One ,later ,thanks guys it is good value for money, I like to use it as second phone for travel and watching movies.Seems quick as of now. Will keep posted. it\\'s almost a BRAND NEW one,what a great deaaaal great phone overall. I received this phone in black little over 3 days ago. amazing screen and very easy to set up. when you make calls the sound is crystal clear. So far so good, no lags, no freezing. I do have cons though. the battery seems to be running out more faster than any other phone i had. I have metro pcs and i havent been able to get signal like i would get signal , then 4g, then no serivce. I have called both blu and Metro pcs and metro pcs on this issue and i was able to get it solved with both. Blu has an excellent customer service patient and understanding. I was able to fix the problem and my phone is now working perfectly .out of 10:front camera 8back camera 10screen 10audio 9calling 10speed 10battery 7download speed 9quality over all 9.5 excelent iteam bout insede missing part like head phone ,booklet and warranty informetion , if i can get it before i live for vaction the rest is oky thank for excelent service ,bravo # uno this phone is great.it is a upgrade from an aspire 2. the phone came with all it described hesdset,charger,battery and as it said IN THE BOX,UNLOCKED.! charged up the phone overnight and was really surprised at all the apps that were installed.i really love baseball so i installed MLB/ATBAT,couldn\\'t download the app, put in a call to MLB SUPPORT and they had me up in 10 min.i like the photo resolution really good photos.this phone is really great for me i text message alot and tweet so i\\'m satisfied with its brightness and clarity ,even the feature i can enlarge the message.only drawback is the battery. Replaced the Pantech 2G. Needed 3G and it does the job. I had been researching for quite some time for an unlocked phone to get out of the contract rat race and found Blu products. I ordered the Pure XL for myself and the Studio Energy X plus for my son. Very impressed with both. Box came with a lot of extras you would typically have to purchase with the other phones. Great look, great camera and best of all.. . Great price! A high end phone without the high end price. Great interface. Highly recommended Great phone Excellent product as expected ..great Excelente Phones ok ... Buy 2 phones unlocked LG and they sent me what they felt like. They sent me one blu phone bone nothing to do with what I asked. They are irresponsible. Do not recommend at all.Compre 2 telefonos desbloqueados LG y me mandaron lo que les dio la gana. Me mandaron 1 telefono blu osea nada que ver con lo que pedi. Son unos irresponsables. No los recomiendo para nada. It is not the beat one of cell phones, but i believe that for the price is a very good deal. It has most of nice functions, it works very well and has a nice design. It is possible uptade android system, but not for the last ones. The only problem is that internal memory is very small, although you can use a SD card for some things. Recommended if you cant buy the expensive ones. Great phone This Phone is like having a computer with you at all times, Crisp clear screen, very responsive, the dual sim thing isn\\'t needed, just turn it off, also to save your battery, turn off background apps and any other apps you aren\\'t using. Once you figure the insides of it, its a good phone.If you have Questions, I\\'ll try to answer them. At this price, as compared, is worth it. This product said it was for Verizon,but it wasn\\'t even there\\'s. this is my third phone by Blu they appear to have a charging problem Had to send it back within the first month. Quit working. Phone battery turned out defective. I had to buy another one. LOVE THIS PHONE As hardware is good even though each phone act different. Not easy to download apps unless comes with ovi. Some setting are different from one phone to another..like web setting one got back arrow and the other got history in the same spot..coz i got 3 already ( not US version, second one dont keep connected to wifi and slow to connect to towers when I drive). In general not as I expected but has a lot of good feature like interent radio..I dunno if I will keep it..its neat phone excellent products high quality and very fast Everything as described! Reccommend! This is my international phone. it works great.. Work perfectly I ordered the BlackBerry 9530 at the last minute hoping that I would get the product for an upcoming birthday. I contact the shipper and they assured me that I would get the product in time. Everything went well the product arrived earlier than expected. On a side note the new unlocked BlackBerry 9530 works wonderfully. Even outside of the United States. Thanks for great service I love this phone , but the one I got have a yellow tint screen , I\\'ll return it.Update : it was tint at first but now its OK and clear . turns out its a normal things in some new phones. I rushed with the first review. 5 stars They send a phone that was icloud password lock, basic is a useless phone. The phone is amazing, i recommend to buy it, great camera, software, is really fast, the only bad thing is the battery, however i believe that all the android phones are like that, enjoy!!!! great cell for price works international no problems all functions work good deal The phone constantly disconnects from the WiFi - it shows an active connection, but no data is being transmitted. WiFi has to be disabled and reenabled to resume connectivity. This is a BIG deal for me, is there a fix and/or workaround? Will return if not....OK phone otherwise - expected battery life, fairly updated OS, good response time, decent pics, etc... One star, only because I can\\'t give it ZERO. The phone is a Japanese model, which is fine if you have to conform to Japanese laws. I\\'m not Japanese nor do I live in Japan. Right away I noticed several features I was unable to turn off because of the model of the phone. Entirely unhappy with this purchase. Excelent I like it!!! Is very good! Thanks! I have always been happy with Amazon.... If you are a windows/office everyday person and really don\\'t need very specific apps, then this phone works great. I\\'m all about connectivity. Calendars, tasks, phone numbers and mails. Windows had worked hard to put out apps that make your life easier when dealing with daily chores on your work. Office works awesome...REAL office that is. Battery is good. Video and audio are pretty awesome too.

Wouldn\\'t recommend the product. In love with the phone! Great phone and arrived early!!! The cellphone came with a scratch on the top-left side ..beside that ,...ok My wife is into talking and texting on the cell phone. She wants no smart phone. Just a simple talk and text phone with a qwerty keypad and internet connection if so desire. She also loves the slider part of the phone which makes it more compact and hides her qwerty pad when not in use. Great phone for the money!

Thanks excelente great product works as new This phone worked for 3 months, now have the screen\\'s touch capability is gone completely. The lower half of the screen has decided not to work whatsoever so I can\\'t even sign in. I\\'m very disappointed because that\\'s 300 dollars that I thought I was putting into a quality product. love it Just started using this phone. Here are some first impressions. More details to follow. Overall, Awesome. Things I was searching for and I like best about this phone. Price: much better price than comparable phones, and this phone is also better in many ways. RAM 3G! with a fast processor. ROM 64 G without any real boat that cannot be easily removed. Net available is about 55G. PLUS an SD card slot. Camera is great, but I am not a photo junkie so you might not love it but 24M is really sharp and better than most at this price. 6\" screen and super vivid. Easy to use with reading apps and easy to hold onto. Finger print scanner works great. NFC and android pay work great. Some of the pre-installed software is actually useful, such as Amazon App Store and the keyboard app has a number pad. Nice things included: silicon case, NFC marks to set up your own NFC commands, headphones like the iphone has. Big enough battery. Very nice speakers that are about as good as my Bluetooth portable speakers. Android 5.1. Works with my BYOP, which is currently Tracfone, BTW I love the warehouse buying option!

Please note my reviews are honest and unbiased, no attempt was made to influence my opinion and the information I have provided is completely and 100% based on my experience with this item. If you would like to review past product reviews for reference, please feel free to visit my profile. [...] A special gift for a relative\\'s hard work in school. I was a bit skeptical at first but I was very impressed. It really is factory unlocked and it works on any network. Very impressed with Apple Express. Recommended seller, the product led me quickly and uneventfully Long battery life and quick charge. Great functions. This LG G3 is fast and the screen is beautiful!I will reconfirm that the 4G will not work in the US on cricket wireless (AT&T network). But the 3G connection is plenty fast enough for my needs and I wanted a 1440p screen for under $300 that was also unlocked.Having both a user replaceable battery and expandable storage is excellent for users who would like to keep there phone for longer than a year.Battery life is good easily lasting throughout the day with average use.Software updates could be more frequent, this phone is still on android 5.0. Rumor has it that 6.0 will be released to the G3 but we\\'ll have to wait and see.The LG software overlay is very functional and doesn\\'t detract from the experience whatsoever.The camera takes excellent photos and is extremely fast to focus. The camera is beyond what most will ever need in a smartphone,You can even use this phone as a remote control but this feature isn\\'t the greatest due to the poor range.I think this is still the only phone available with a 1440p screen in this price range and the extra GB of ram on the international version is appreciated. I recommend buying a glass screen cover to protect the beautiful screen. The phone came dirty. It works but is cleaning it off too much to ask? My husband refuses to ever upgrade to any other phone. We had to buy a replacement of his original tundra...not because of water damage or being dropped one to many times but because he dropped it on the big island on a mission and a humvee ran over it...two times, and only damaged the screen :) I bought many phones of this model for friends and for my use. All of them were working perfect at the first months. Couple of months later problems came with them. Mine one used to restart during phone conversations. Contact and other applicaions give error and I have to close them. Alarm mode does not works. If I try a phone call it takes long to beep or dialing. Not factory unlocked to uninstall app not needed. I had the first model and GPS works great, this one not. So I would not recomend this model. The big problem looks like to be a model manufactured exclusively for T-Mobil and Metro PCS. If they are used out from USA there are not posibilities to update when updates are available. I have done root and any how the same problem with update. My last problem at the time. The phone is everything I expected! I have been an IPhone user since 2011 and I am not going anywhere! I like its design. Battery keeps all day long. It meets all my needs. This was perfectly authentic. My phone does usually die around 5-9% however but that\\'s fine since it is a used phone and little things like that are to be expected. I stuck this baby in an otterbox and stuck a glass screen protector on it. Awesome purchase! Love phone BLU has no lollipop update. Excelente official lg great for travelling or just always on the go. a necessity for the g4 power issue. As expected. i love Excellent! !! I can use reo línea and have Androit and I can install reo lo e from different server the phone does not work, this is a scam... false advertisement that it is an unlocked phone. The phone does not even turn on. thanks it\\'s waaack It did not charge at first then I figured it was the charger. Once I got a good charger it worked, well I could make calls on it but it would not ring a call through. I received yesterday, when I installed the simm (wich is working on other unlocked iphone 4 32gb), I realized that it is not unlocked, because the simm is invalid. I need as urgent to solve this problem. Please help me !!!!! Phone is a Christmas present for grand daughter who really wants one but can\\'t get it for herself. I think she will really love it. Price was right, packing secure, and delivery fast. Saludos, el presente es para dejar constancia que quede bastante satisfecho por el articulo comprado el mismo satisfizo todas mis espectativas I received the package really quick! Which was great. Now, is the bad news. Plugged in battery and my sim card and the phone had to do an system update. The phone would never recover, it kept rebooting and locking up. Sometimes it would finish and I would try to browse through the phone, but it kept rebooting and locking up. REALLY! Soo frustrating to get a new item and its fried! Well anyways, called the so called support number ( SAMSUNG ) and it was an automated sales pitch trying to sell me a CRUSE LINE TICKET!! I COULD NEVER GET THROUGH! I had to use google to find an alternate number for support! I have never in my life been so angry, or felt so helpless. You would think that the items you purchase would be tested before being sold. Who can you trust anymore? It’s a great smartphone, i’m very satistified with it. had this for a few days now and if it keeps working like it is, great phone for the price. I kept buying no name phones, last one was $200, lasted me 2 years. Im hoping this one at least lasts that long. I see a lot of ppl complaining about the battery, I find it pretty decent, all apps working very fast. just turn down the phone brightness. cant seem to figure out how to turn off the vibration for when you type, no big deal tho.for ppl with straight talk, the pre-programmed APN settings do not work.( at least for me) I have the APN setting that gets you 4G, works great. just message if you need the setting. I bought this phone and am using it with straight talk. Great phone that is fast and takes great pictures. htc evo 4G phone. new in perfect condition, is working fast and is with full extras. if I can used back home in europe, never woud sale this phone. Great product for the price. I am not really using it as a phone as much as I am using it for a gaming device with the added feature of being a phone and WiFi hot spot. It was better than I expected and works great on overseas GSM networks. I do not use the camera but the pictures taken were decent if I had to use them. It has allot of features that I am playing with and have I have not been disappointed with so far. I am a Iphone person so, I am impressed with its similarity to my old Samsung Note 3. Nice phone, BUT I returned it due to not being able to receive 3G data on AT&T network in my area (EDGE:2 only). Frequencies did not match. If that had worked, I certainly would have kept the phone. Screen looked great. Responsive. All good, the phone meets expectations, works well in venezuela in all movistar, digitel and movilnet This product has no warranty. It was damaged four months of use and I lost all the money., then the screen went black. The seller did not want to be responsible. Excelent cellphone QUICK DELIVERY EXCELLENT PRODUCT RECOMMEND ALL \\'Had the phone for three days - I charged the battery as soon as it arrived (already showing 56% and a \\'manufacture date of 7 months ago!)... now fully charged and in it\\'s THIRD full day of use - battery is down to 48%. YES folks, this battery is a monster. \\'Have yet to fully assess the workability of this phone (it\\'s a replacement for my wife\\'s company-owned iPhone) but all signals point to it being a GREAT choice. Everyone who sees it marvels at the screen res/quality and the up-market look/feel of the whole unit. Their jaws drop when I tell them the price!! The box is full of goodies (screen protector... \\'tho we\\'ll be replacing that with a shatter-proof glass one today) and the online manual is easy to print off and use... once you get over the idiosyncrasies of the translated lingo! \\'May be back to add/review this review soon - but, for now 5-out-of-5 to BLU phones. This phone is good price and great screen. Actually after I bought Just Before HTC one X + released.Still I am so glad to have this phone. love it A good productVery nice... broke in 1 month DONT BUY! Perfect Thisphone is not unlocked my friend can\\'t use it. Phone is brand new and correct E71x. I have had one for 2 years and it is getting worn out. Easy to navigate and works well as a PHONE, and texting which is most important to me. Not easily available from ATT, so now i have a new one for when my old one dies. I refuse to be come a touch screen user! very bad. excelente Lovely phone Phone has potential but it needs some improvements. I honestly think its a steal for the price I paid. The camera is pretty nice. The quality is pretty good as well but I\\'ve had issues with the software and the keyboard is annoying. The accuration is off on the keyboard and the calibration is weak at times but other than that it\\'s a pretty good phone. buen producto con llegada rápida de atención y tiempo, la especificación deseada sin problemas de contratiempo recomendado este vendedor ok The product arrived on time. After 2 days the battery would not hold a charge for more than 15 minutes. After contacting the company by email, with an immediate response at 8:15pm Eastern time, a new battery arrived in 2 days. No hassle and polite customer service. I will definitely use this company again!! excelente This phone is a fantastic value! Flagship-level performance at a mid-tier price. Best value in Android phones out there right now. Better than I expected for a used phone,looks new,no scratches,no cracks,very satisfied with the purchase. OMG ALL PERFECT What is the warranty policy? Purchased at end of July but never used it. It does not power on. awesome Phone! the delivery coming very fast. bueno This phone look nice I buy new phone but they send me use phone and the apps don\\'t work it won\\'t open. I had to send it back Awesome !!!! Loving it 💘 Doesn\\'t really connect with apple great nexus phone in terms of price for the feature you get bought it for wife and she thinks its nice and does its job well cant really complain no contract phone and instant updates from google Wow! I ordered two of these refurbished phones and was surprised at the condition. I looked them over very carefully and could not find any signs of previous use. I have ordered other refurbished phone from the actual carriers that have not looked as good as these. I have not read the other reviews on these phones or the seller, but in my case, I am very well satisfied with the purchase. I have been testing them out for two weeks now, and there has been no malfunction whatsoever. In my case, they look and have been performing as brand new phones. They are set for T-Mobile and had no issue setting them up. Just put in my SIM, and logged in my Google/Android account. Excellent service. The phone arrived on time and complete. Product recieved is as discribed. No problem start up. Installed activated sim card and phone was ready to use. It doesn\\'t have lte...works as expected but has blackout spots through the out metro areas.. Perfect I love my phone the only thing s I can\\'t get pictures messages with metro pcs ... Maybe with T-Mobile I will try soon Pretty cool, atnt no longer works with it since there is no 2g, only tmobile prepay. Thanks Excelente!! Pros:- It\\'s nice and compact. Light weight too, so it fits easily in a shirt pocket.- Very good voice call quality. As good as my iPhone 4.- Decent battery life. What a breath of fresh air when compared to the power sucking smartphones that have brought in the age of cellphone cases with battery packs. The initial charge on this Nokia led to a standby time of over a week. Now, it averages about 3-4 days between charges. This is with mild use since I use my iPhone more.- Quite a configurable user interface.- It has a immediate screen locking button to prevent inadvertent activity via the touch screen.Cons:- I\\'m not convinced the touch screen really improves usability and was likely included as a gimmick to improve sales or potential buyer interest.- The touch screen is just ... OK. The sensitivity is just acceptable and I often end up selecting items while trying to scroll.- Unfortunately, some features are accessible only via the touch screen. I wish this weren\\'t the case but....- Working with the address book can be tedious since I can search only via the first or last names depending on how you choose to list names, i.e., first then last as opposed to last then first.Overall, it\\'s a pretty good phone. I purchased it since I didn\\'t need two smartphones and it has delivered in its light weightedness, simplicity and longer battery life. However, I can\\'t say that I\\'m impressed with the touch screen feature. I\\'m happy to see that simpler phones are still in circulation. The smartphone craze and general feature overkill are getting out of hand. I buy a new phone monthly, or at least I have for the past 5 or so months. After going through and Xperia Z1 compact, an Iphone 5c, a Blu Life Pure Mini and another One M7.. I can say without a doubt the M7 is the best phone I have ever used. I sold my first one thinking the SD 600 was dated and having an 800 would make a difference, it didn\\'t.Htc put this phone together so well it still amazes me. Every aspect of it is perfect. Keep in mind tho the colored aluminum is prone to scratches so get a case. I recommend UAG.. best case for this phone by far. It came in great packaging with a wall charger, usb cable and headphones, Also came with an OEM Htc micro sim opener (very cool) and a screen protector.The phone itself is in good shape, minus some slight scratching around the front edges.. but after putting the phone in it\\'s brand new UAG case you can\\'t see them at all. The first M7 i purchased had the infamous \"puple\" camera.. this one does not, thankfully. My only gripe is I use a Net10 simcard so I can\\'t receive updates since this is an unlocked AT&T phone.. so I am stuck on android 4.1.2Next weekend im going into att and if i can activate it on their service with a garuntee that i will receive the update to lollipop or atleast kit-kat i\\'ll gladly pay the extra 20 a month.If you are like me and are buying an unlocked phone and you want the full package, without spending 300+ dollars, the M7 is for you. Its Snapdragon 600 with Adreno 320 will handle anything you can toss it\\'s way with ease. The camera reminds me of my iphone, which is very rare for android phones.. most of the cameras out there are terrible. The all aluminum body is stellar, and the screen pops like no other phone i\\'ve used, so sharp and bright. (be sure to get a screen protector, preferably tempered glass @ .3 mm) keep in mind that the battery is not the largest by any means and this is an ATT phone.. so unless you use their service or root your phone with a custom rom, you will be stuck with jellybean.I bought from BREED, so I cannot speak for any of the other sellers. They sent out a great unit for the money that included all accessories. The last M7 i bought off amazon came in a week with just the phone and a broken otterbox.. and cost $70 more. But it\\'d had been updated to 4.4.4This will be my last phone purchase for a year or more, buy one now while you can.. HTC is a great company that will support it\\'s flagships to the grave. It\\'s big brother the M8 could never quite recrate the rugged, industrial look that I love about the M7 but it\\'s snapdragon 801 is impressive. I will probably buy the M9 next.. but lets see what it has in store first. I know this phone inside and out so feel free to ask me any questions! Really liking this case, I\\'m coming from an otter box commuter case and I always wondered if they made one that was one piece. It was $45 at Best Buy so this was a no brainer to buy it on Amazon. To me the case is sleeker than the commuter case and covers the rounded corners of the screen better. I\\'m using it on a 6s plus and it fits like a glove. Worked really well for a few months. Now the sound only works if it is on speaker phone. At this point I only really use it to access the internet and messenger. For this function it is good. For phone calls and skype it is nearly worthless. Especially skype or any app like snap chat it loads too slow. All videos are very pixalated. Even when I send them. Camera is also pretty crappy compared to other phones I have had. (Nexus 5, Samsung Galaxy3) Now that the memory is almost already full (in only 6 monthes) I have to restart it A LOT, apps crash a lot/ freeze and the camera has problems. I only purchased because I am living out of the country and wanted a cheap phone that I don\\'t have to insure. For that purpose I believe it has met my expectations. Also can hold two sim cards which is very nice as I travel back and forth and need to switch carriers. Compared to cost of other phones that i have had before and comparing it\\'s processing to it is good value. 1/5th of the price!!!! The appearance is very nice. Even the guy in the cell phone store thought it was an iphone 6. Also very durable and comes with a screen protector and case which is convenient and saves money. Battery life is good. I charge every night even though it never gets below 50% (unless I\\'m using constantly all day), also charges fairly fast.Don\\'t get it you are expecting it to act like a $400 phone. I think it would be a GREAT fit for 1st time smart phone owners. Terrific phone. Battery life is low side. Very good phone, the only thing missing is predicted for texting DealFisher you are the best Great phone I bought this for my mom and it\\'s given me problems with it being unlocked and all....it says it\\'s unlocked so why is it giving me problems tho very good I highly recommend you do NOT purchase this junk phone! I had high expectations and they were all crushed like a crumbled piece of paper. DO NOT PURCHASE! The Samsung Evergreen may spend most of its time hung up while \"initializing\" the contacts. Samsung says the problem doesn\\'t exist. The Internet disagrees. I am using my phone as a paper weight now. Nice Otterboxs are awesome My wife loves it, enough said. goods We paid the \"new\" price for this phone, but the one that arrived was used. When we went to activate with Sprint, we were told that the prior owner left a balance owing and that we had to pay that in order to activate the phone. I am trying to return phone now. This phone was just as I was wishing for, but one slight problem (worry). It has a sim card of AT&T and it has unlimited text, call, and 4G LTE data. So if I use those will I get charged or no? Very cheap, looed cheap, dosent do anything worth having it besides to see a text message aomeone sent you. FB or no other app works on it and you can fit a sim card into it even if you take it apart. The micro sd never wors either. Worthless buy. The range for calls is very limited. Great purchase! I\\'m loving my iPhone. I\\'m getting used to my first Apple product. Ease & comfort comes with this iPhone. Unable to unlock it from T-Mobile, contacted them numerous times to unlock the phone however not unlocked till now, so forced to use only in T-Mobile it was very nice thank you so much. and it helps a lot Very smart. Accurate. Sometimes messes up but usually it\\'s just me hitting the wrong button. Excellent product and delivery in time! I always have been an andriod fan i love this phone better than my iphone everything works great!! I had to wait a couple of days so my at&t sim card can work but besides that I love it........does anyone knows if they sell the stylus from the phone alone ??? excelente The phone I got was highly used, many dinks on the side. the front touch screen was replaced with after market junk. The touch screen stopped working after two weeks. The wifi and LTE data also slowed to a crawl. I don\\'t recommend a used iPhone. It\\'s not what I wanted it\\'s not upgradable. It\\'s worthless. Hola amigos, compre este telefono con la plena confianza de que recibiria un buen producto mi mayor sorpresa fue que recibi un telefono usado con una bateria china usada y maltratada, el track ball defectuoso la tapa no calza, sin audifonos, un cable de datos motorola y por la caja se ve a leguas que este es un producto reconstruido afortunadamente le funciona el teclado, el pin, pero no es la idea no recomiendo comprar telefonos desbloqueados por esta via. Hola, soy de Venezuela y debo decir que comprar el telefono fue una excelente inversion.Todo legal y nuevo de paquete, todos sus accesorios funcionan. Ademas trajo una memoria MicroSD de 2GB.Hello, I\\'m from Venezuela and I must say that buying the phone was an excellent investment.All legal and new package, all accessories work. You brought a 2GB MicroSD memory. To be a 230$ phone, it\\'s amazing! I have a 700$ phone that doesn\\'t even compare!! The camera is just perfect. The phone itself is very sleek and comfortable to use. It\\'s also very very fast. I\\'ve been playing around with it for about 2 weeks and I can\\'t think of a single thing I don\\'t like about this phone. The power and volumes buttons took some getting used to, but I like the placement. The UI of the phone is gorgeous, and super customizable. In short, I think it\\'s a really great phone. Nice!! bueno Ok i got it today, but i have a worry, my question is , is it open for any sim card from any country? Coz i want to send it to cameroon to a cousin. Please let me knowso i can order more If you want to text and talk, this is all this phone is good for. Sprint started dropping items that this phone could do. My advice, don\\'t waste your time on this phone. Great phone greAt condition had a great experience and will be ordering from them again if ever need a new phone thank you Beautiful bud very bad product touch screen working the very next day I received it Got good deal for 32gb, but home button did not work. Had to pay to change the button. Overall the phone works. Battery last only a day on standby. The best sellers so far...it fall and the screen is broke Overall it\\'s a pretty decent case. My only complaint is that it is loose around the power button and volume rocker. Besides that it\\'s comfortable to hold and has a good looking design This is my second Otterbox Defender, my first being for my first S4. My first Otterbox Defender saved my phone several times. This case seems like ultimate protection against most everyday accidents without impeding the phones capabilities. sometimes using the fingerprint scanner on the S5 seems difficult, could be because of the case, but i cannot say with certainty because i have not tried it without the case. Very good product. Worked perfectly with straight talk sim card. I would recomend it to anyone looking for a cheap Iphone. Just as expected. Awesome cellphone, the size is perfect and the responsiveness is as good as it can get. For $300 you\\'re getting way more than what you\\'re paying for.If you\\'re an international buyer, please do check the provider\\'s LTE bands in order for it to work as published. nicenewcaozhi Works well If you update to android N (7.0), your device will most likely enter in a bootloop because of a \"hardware related issue\", according to Google... Device is overheating a lot, frezzing up a lot and turning off by itself, I have to take battery out so it can work awesome!!! Excellent item the phone is great but there is no instructions with it. it is easy too use it has a lot of good features. This item had no iPhone in box box was resealed with some weird black tape only had ear buds and charger in box and box was in Japanese horrible fraud good phone Buenisimo Really can\\'t beat this phone at this price point. If you\\'re sensible and don\\'t care about brand names, I recommend it. The only thing this phone falls shot on, compared to the higher end phones, is screen brightness while you\\'re in direct sunlight. Excelente It was a little more beat up than the picture showed. It does work fine on the other hand :) This phone is amazing! I love it. It got 13 mp camera front and rear which is working awesome.The touch is very nice smooth.But you don\\'t have much options for case. The screen is crystal clear and feels like real. It\\'s worth for what you pay. fino It\\'s not good..it\\'s hanging...Seems like software is too slow I like the fact that you can play your music from your phone on the watch and the speaker is pretty loud for music and voice calls. It look and feel good too. You can put your Sim card in the watch itself and put your phone in the drawer! I like the practicality. Great buy!I would highly recommend this watch to others. Good deal!! thanks, this phone is nice First Android phone that I bought and I really like it is fast and easy to use. Had an Iphone for the last 5 years. But I really like this phone battery life is nice. I\\'m not a heavy user right now because of were I am working but the battery is great. sound good as well. I really like this phone. Phone worked for two days then just blacked out! Not sure I\\'d buy another refurbished product. This is the second phone i have purchased, and the phone has went out plus when someone calls u can not hear them, getting ready to send it back Nice el telefono llego bien! la tienda responde y manda todo al dia! el detalle sq como es blackberry se funde rapido no aguanta pela es muy delicado!! es bueno para gente q no le saca la chicha a los telefonos desde venezuela It work only for two weeks . After two weeks its dead. Mp3 did not work and blue tooth too. Not really recomended. Its a waste of money. Excellent great phone, only cons: yo can not use the wifi spot in this att phone, as this feature is blocked. best phone ever :) Excelent phone Phone was advertised as unlocked, and DealFisher assured me it was compatable with my carrier. But neither came true so I had to return it. Had it not been a Christmas present... Blackberry Storm2 9550 Unlocked Phone is a great product for me and the kind of activities that I realize... i recommended It did not work at all. The screen just stayed on white the whole time. I was cautious about ordering a phone from a second party like this, but I was very pleasantly surprised at the service and the quality of the phone. The phone is very nice. There are no scratches anywhere. It works perfectly. I was also contacted by the company about a week after I received the phone just to be sure that it was received fine. They were very professional. I have recommended them to my friends. it works perfectly exellent Takes clare pics awesome resolution. But the performance of the phone has some lacks..you can see the previous screen everytime u hit the back bottom it gets really annoying to see the shadows of your previous screen. fine Nice phone, good price. HAD A LIL WERE AND TEAR BUT THE PHONE IS GREAT .BUTTONS ALL WORK.CALLS TEXTS,ND HOLDS A GR8 CHARGE..I RECOMEND THIS PHONE. GREAT PHONE A MUST BUY It was everything I expected it to be and arrived before the date amazon had set. Bought this cell phone in January and now it beeps all the time as if being charged. This causes the battery to drain really fast and the only way to stop the noise is to set it to vibrate. I\\'ve formatted and updated everything but it keeps beeping. I read on the net of several people having the same problem. Also the battery icon shows it to be charging even though it\\'s not.Really disappointed in the quality of the hardware, WP 7.5 is great though. Nobody buys a cell phone expecting it to last 9 months for god\\'s sake!!Samsung never again!! After 3 month only the vibration stopped and not working anymore !!!! doesn\\'t have a camera and can\\'t bluetooth Was different,flashy and the talk of all my friends,Not expensive like the over rated \"galaxy\" cellphone watches! A real good choose. Great phone for the price. In perfect condition works wonderfully, no problems! Excellent! !!! Good phone for the dolars spent touch pad is not so quick especially home and return buttons cam is decent battery on standard micro sim is used battery not remvable gets hot when used with multi tasks Im very happy with my BB and the service Amazon gave me. I had a problem with my first shipping...no BB in the box, I was shocked. I called and they sent me a new one. Now Im happy! Thanks Amazon for helping me. It\\'s a excellent product and it was on time. I recommend it a lot Wife wanted a cheap Android phone to go back to when she got feed up with the Nokia Lumia 900 she had. For her to go to this meant she hated the Lumia 900. She really didn\\'t hate the phone just the reception issues that plagued her Lumia 900. With this phone the issues are gone and she can play with a bit more apps then what she had before. Thanks for the item, its great The item appeared to be slightly used, re-packaged and not brand new in box as advertised. Box was not sealed but had been opened and SIM card had been installed but nevertheless acceptable. The charger port quit working after a month of having and the screen always goes black! I purchased this cell for my sister as a birthday gift and she loved it! it was easy to set up and she hasn\\'t had a single issue with it yet. She loves how fast it is for all her online browsing and social media updating. A great buy for sure! Great phone no issues for me Due to some discussion about very different flavors of this phone being shipped by different sellers, this review is for a phone sent to me by UNLOCKED CELL PHONE KINGS INC via Amazon. Delivery was prompt and the item was in brand new condition (if it wasn\\'t they sure did a great job making it look that way). Mine came with a very brief manual (if you want to call it that) in English, with the phone set to UK English. This is my first even semi-smart phone, but I have some experience as an Android tablet user so it wasn\\'t all new to me.I have several USB cables with male USB mini connectors. This phone uses a USB micro connector for charging and data transfer so I bought some mini-to-micro adapters so I could use the stuff I have, but the adapters turned out to be useless. The female USB micro port on the phone is recessed in the housing such that the male USB micro fits only if it will fit inside this very, very small housing. The adapters I bought, though small, were too big to allow the male plug to be inserted deep enough into the female to make a connection (or even stay in place - they fall right out). I\\'m thinking I\\'m going to have to get genuine Samsung cables from somewhere but haven\\'t finished looking around yet.The power adapter, which has the proper size USB micro male on it, is a European plug design and it comes with a plug adapter, presumably so it can be used in the US. While you can indeed plug it into a 110/120V outlet in the US with the adapter, it has absolutely no effect on the phone. It doesn\\'t charge at all. I\\'m guessing it expects more voltage, but whatever. The cable is built into the transformer and so is useless as a spare data or charging cable. Also, apparently not all charging cables will transfer data as well as charge. Be careful when looking at charging cables or kits to make sure you get one that can both charge the device *and* transfer data between the phone and your computer. If it just says it\\'s for charging, it is probably not for both purposes.That means that this package contains one and only one usable cable for charging and data sync, via a standard USB connection on the PC side of things and a micro USB male on the phone side. You will probably want to plan to buy a spare or two but I don\\'t have a recommendation on that yet because the USB micro female port on the phone won\\'t accept just any USB micro male. It has to be in a really, really small housing.I couldn\\'t use the camera app or install the Amazon App Store (or several other items) until I put a 32GB micro SD card in the phone (all 32GB were recognized). Get an SD card installed before you start trying to install much of anything; it solves a number of problems.The Android Market and the Amazon App store initially reported that several apps were not compatible with my device. I downloaded and installed Samsung Kies on my Win 7 Home Premium 64 bit machine with no problems. Then closed it down and started it again and it asked if I wanted to update it and I said yes. So it updated, and then asked if I wanted to upgrade the firmware in my phone. I said yes. After I did this (by this point I had already installed the SD card), app installations have been smooth as silk, even the often aggravating Words With Friends which seems to decide that any device you have is incompatible about every other week.I recommend you look for \"App2SD\" or a similar application that allows you to move (or which automatically moves) applications to your SD card instead of letting them hog space in the limited onboard phone memory. Some apps must live in the phone but others can live on the SD card.I had trouble with the Bluetooth phone application in my car (a late model Hyundai) and found that others have too. I paired the phone with the car successfully and could make and receive hands-free calls through the system with no trouble. I could not get my phonebook/contact list to download from the phone into my car, though. After much aggravation and searching, I found a post on a board that suggested a free Android app called Bluetooth File Transfer. Download and install that app; start it; hit Menu; hit More; hit Send Contacts; Select All (or whatever you want); hit Send As Single. The app blasted my contact/phonebook list out into the ether where the car saw them floating around (the car was configured to auto-download) and sucked them all in. Et voila! Yes, I do have to remember to refresh the car\\'s copy from time to time but I can live with that.The screen scratches pretty easily; you may want to consider a protector.And oh yes, I bought a 1500mAh battery because of so many people saying the battery life was lousy. At least for now, my battery life with the originally supplied battery is excellent IMHO with Bluetooth and WiFi on 24/7. But you always need a spare battery lying in a drawer somewhere.This sounds almost like a list of complaints but I don\\'t mean it to be. I like this phone and would recommend it highly. All I need now are a few cheap cables and a few accessories, which I always seem to need when I get something like this. It has taken about a week of on-again, off-again diddling to get it largely where I want it, but that\\'s not unreasonable for a new tech toy. If you are new to Android expect it to take a bit longer, but that\\'s not the phone\\'s fault - it\\'s just how it is. I hope some of these comments are useful if you are considering or have bought this phone. This iphone 6 plus, 16gb/unlocked came with a 60 day warranty & we had no problems with it in those 60 days. In the 30 days that followed, the phone began crashing. It had green/black screen that would flash a white line and then appear to be asleep. The phone would not wake from this screen. We did a hard reset(pressing home key & power key simultaneously) and then plugged into itunes to restore. Restoring worked a few times to wake the phone or to actually restore it. We contacted the Seller (Solar Tech LLC) and Amazon, so far we have only heard from Solar Tech who told us we were out of warranty & therefore out of luck. We then took the phone to the Apple store who told us that it could not be restored. They would gladly repair it for the out of warranty fee of $329 or we could trade in our $500 broken phone and pay $300+ to purchase another refurbished phone w/ a 90 day warranty. We left the store w/ our broken phone and then ordered an iphone 5 from a different seller on Amazon. We will wait for the 7 to come out and possibly replace the 6plus when the prices come down. If you have an issue report it immediately, do not wait like we did, hoping it would get better. I love it el producto me vino en muy mal estado y las piensan estaban usada. estoy muy descontento con el producto comprado The quality of the actual product was very nice and sturdy. The only problems I had with this product was that the Bluetooth kept disconnecting every few minutes. The step counter would reset every so often without me prompting it to. Wow... I love the cell phone... 💜 I bought this when it came out. I liked the phone but after it stopped working i was not able to do anything. I contacted Amazon, the seller, nothing.I contacted Samsung US because i live in US, they did not do anything because it is international model manufactured in England or India. They gave me phone # to call after many phone calls. India number was very weird so I contacted Samsung UK. People were very nice but deflected me to some web site UK and said they do not accept packages from abroad. So i sent it to my mom in EU. She send it then to UK. And even though Samsung\\'s manufacturers warranty is 2 years they did not fix my phone! Even though it was less than 1 year old. Anyways they all toss it around like a hot potato. I thought it is Samsung - meaning every official Samsung branch i take it to should take my phone and fix it even if they have to ship it to China! What is manufacturer\\'s warranty? Nothing? Excellent product Best phone for the price. I truly love this phone it has a large bright screen its fast and is thin. The only drawback it has is the camera is not that good. Pretty decent product at a very reasonable price Great phone, though not eligible for Google Android 7 \"Nougat\" update from Google. But still a fast phone, great screen, supports Qi wireless charging (on Google, LTE, or third party Qi chargers), and cases & protectors are now quite affordable as well. Still a solid backup phone or a low-cost-to-replace secondary phone. Last Google factory image as of this writing is 6.0.1 Marshmallow, M4B30X. not good Very practical phone: large screen, lightweight, and high sound quality. Love this phone! Easy to use and all apps I have loaded have worked flawlessly! This phone was a hell of a value when you compare its features and benefits as compared to other more expensive models! You needn\\'t look further than this phone! I m troubling with this phone really i hate this its keep on rebooting and its getting heat if i talk more than 5 mins and battery life is not good. Perfect. The phone came with all the accesories. nice It fitted perfectly on my Note 3. I have installed the ILoome 9H, and the edges of both fit exactly. Excelente The 5 stars is not because this is the best phone ever... I do however feel it was the best deal for the money. From the little time I have had the phone I do notice the battery, once in use, goes quickly, but for my needs no real issue as I mainly text. Was concerned about problems using a tracfone sim card and the number transfer took a long time but again no hiccups.The phone is clear, runs apps better than my old LG. Hooking my wife up with same right now as early Christmas present. Very impressed so far. It\\'s a beautiful phone. Not new to me because I\\'ve owned iPhones for a number of years, the last one being a 6 PLUS. Great Works for iPhone 6 to split the audio in and audio out of the phone to two phono jacks for connection of external devices such as a wired speaker or microphone. There are so many things that I liked about this product, that it is an easy spend for me. Here are the Pros and Cons:Pros:* Screen resolution is fantastic. I really wanted my phone to be 1920x1080, but even if this phone is not, the ppi is high enough to give a crispy look.* Bought myself a 32gb Micro SD card, I have been able to load most of my apps and songs without any problems.* The device has dual SIM card, which is quite useful as I travel quite a bit internationally, and don\\'t have to sit at airports and change SIM cards.* Speaker on this phone is quite good! To a point where I listen to music just like that! (without even headphones)* Battery life is superb! Fully charged phone with about 40 - 50 minutes of call and the data line \"ON\" all the time, lasts for about 2-1/2 to 3 days. [Yes, I prefer to use Cell phone only for the purposes of quick communication and not as a long time use device for phone calls. That is what land lines are for :-) ]* Windows 8.1 Phone works very well on this device.* Comes with the Gel Cover, which really protects the device and fits snuggly. No need to spend another $10-$15 on that.* Looks very nice too, thin and weighs very less! People do take attention to the phone!Cons:* The processor is a low-end processor which does affect the performance when dealing with laborious tasks. (for example, when using OWA, if there are 200+ mails on the inbox unread, zooming in or zooming out takes a few seconds of delay (whereas, I don\\'t see that issue in my Nokia 920). Similar problem when using \"swipe\" keyboard.* Doesn\\'t support LTE, which reduces its use for me when I am in US (AT&T Network)* I am not sure how the device software update is going to work, will have to wait and see -- since it is not carrier attached.Overall, great worth, and would whole heartedly recommend to any one! My wife surprised me on Father\\'s Day with this phone and I couldn\\'t be more pleased. It is well built with a beautiful display and the class leading BlackBerry keyboard. Sure, it is missing a few Android apps but that\\'s not a deal breaker. The Hub is a great single source for all your notifications. I also own a Passport and now have the best of both worlds. The phone was great and met all of my expectations. Thank you very much. I had to send this phone back to the seller. It was dirty when I got it, so I thought, since it less than $40 a little clean up wasn\\'t bad. Also the slider to open the keyboard was sticking. Had to really clean that part of the phone?? I set the phone up, and was ready to use it. The last thing I tried to do was call out. Everything was good except for that very important feature.Live and learn. What a nice and elegant phone!! At first, I had difficulty choosing between this model and the Edge one. Finally, I choose versatility and a practical phone. Edge is fashion, but in the daily use, I felt it was going to be bigger and uncomfortable to hold/carry.This phone is very fast, just what I wanted. 4G in Argentina is fast, so I can netsurf at high speed. I\\'m very happy with this purchase! Great Samsung product! The sound on this phone/wTch is great. Enjoying it very much. es de excelente servicio de buena calidad sus productos con una rápida entrega y sin inconvenientes alguno, 100 % recomendado Great phone.. I like the phone but it\\'s really not anything I can do with This phone is very simple, but gets the basics done with orderly and quick fashion. It has pretty fast wifi and also a 5 MP camera. It does have a few flaws though. The camera does not have flash and the touchscreen is rather poor.Buy this product if you want a really basic wifi phone that works well and is reliable. I love it Have had this phone for quite some time and purchased it because it could be used with the Straight Talk service. Received it quickly with easy to use set up and instructions. Excellent Product, recomended 100% So after using this phone for a while now, I\\'ve come to a conclusion that this is a great phone for the price I paid. There was just a new system upgrade so the phone works faster and the video quality is awesome. And also don\\'t buy a phone case because it comes with one already in the box. Excelente teléfono I got this for my brother for a Christmas present - haven\\'t heard back yet, but no news is good news (^_^) just as i expected. Surprisingly looked brand new. Came earlier then I thought it would. I have always purchased less expensive cases, and was always happy. I was really impressed with this case. I wear it at work and I have a very physical job and the belt clip is holding up really well I love my phone and good price for it Excellent This cell phone has a wow about it. I love everything about it...No complaints from me. Just hated I drop my phone in water and It still ran for a good month before dying on me. I will be getting me another one soon. Having slippy fingers don\\'t let you enjoy the cell phone....lol. On the serious note \"a Damn good cell phone. I bought one of this and the GPS didn\\'t work. I return it but before i contact the brand and i they do not help in anything. Be careful this cell have great specs but the quality is not very good. please notice, sprint only Very good, authentic unopened iPhone 5c I like this phone works perfect Nice I completely LOVE my new iPhone!! It came with no scratches and right on time! No complaints at all. It was unlocked and I had no issues with connecting with my carrier. Thank you soooo much 👍 nICE LITTLE PHONE. Love everything it works wonderfully couldn\\'t be more happier After reading some of the other reviews I was kind of worried it would not be in great condition, or it would have a big scratch or button that didn\\'t work. That was not the case, the phone came in almost perfect condition, and after taking it to AT&T it was unlocked and I was up and running in no time.I am very pleased with this purchase, and the price was FANTASTIC! Hi I got samsung s6 todayNot much explored the phone but 2 things observed1) battery is very hot after few mins of charging , Is it safe or should I return back ?2) at the back of samsung phone , samsung 6 is not printed . Is this original piece . How should I verify ? Crappy phone 3g doesn\\'t even work. Wish I could get a refund. Wish it worked right. Already had to buy a new phone. Good Great guy. Very helpful! This was a very good purchase! Truly certified refurbished! Not just cleaned up and sent out. Works great! Thanks very much, and I will certainly feel free to buy from this seller again! Great buy. Seller shipped it to me very quickly and it was in great condition. Exactly as posted. awesome, works well This is truly a one of a kind phone. And it does everything it says it does. I was surprised to discover it does receive text messages you just can\\'t send them. The seller (CBS) wasn\\'t sure if it would work on the AT&T network but my prepaid AT&T SIM card worked fine. I got a \"SIM card registration error\" with my T-mobile SIM card however. This phone is very unique and simple to use and it will turn heads. I\\'m a happy customer. You can see the crack above the home button. It runs up by my arm you can see the crack clearly Didn\\'t like it and returned it While the phone has a quality feel to it and a very nice display, I was very disappointed with the ear piece. For some reason the ear piece is off set. Mean it\\'s not in the middle of the phone, so you have to awkwardly place your ear on the right side so you can hear the person on the other end. Also I was in areas that I got excellent service from my older phones and for some reason this phone would constantly lose service. I immediately returned this phone and ordered something else. Amazon smartphone and good seller Great Phone! What can I say, the E71 is great! The build quality is outstanding, a very solid phone with no squeaks or loose parts. The only thing you need to do is get the new firmware update which was released in early DEC. \\'10 & then your good to go. Not the same quality as Galaxy S5 Lousy phone. Has no mobile data connection no matter what I\\'ve tried to do. Doesn\\'t get SMS on time. Had to spend 3 hours with a support representative just to open it. I\\'m really disappointed. Was bent a little bit when I got it just perfect Love my BLU phone. I converted from iPhone 5. I am not disappointed. Some of the button placements could be a little more convenient. But overall an excellent phone. Right out of the box , after inserting sim card . Says searching......That\\'s it . Stupidly, I bought a second, pink one , thinking it was a different brand . It doesn\\'t work either. Awsome colors Product was as described A great buy A++++ excelent Extremely good reception and Wifi, however trying to find a case cover was difficult. Accidentally dropped mine so as a remember, order a jacket to protect the phone if you can find one that will fit.dg Love it \"Un-fixable\" problems with the sim card port. The phone just cannot read the sim cards. Technicians just can\\'t fix unless it is sent back to Nokia.. This product missing a lot don\\'t even have a stop watch,calculator plus I pay for 2 day shipping and got in 3 day s The phone does not work with my Tmobile SIM card. the iphone is good! but i have an issue the headphones are \"fake\" plastic not rubbery like the original I expected better but its ok! Motorola RAZR V3m Arrived in in good shape and on time. It came with a charger but the battery doesn\\'t always hold a charge. very good phone for the price very good Great No Problem Today i jzt take a pic with the Phone trying for the first time the Watter resistence and is totally fake so if u r looking for a Phone that can do this keep looking My Phone gets crazy and lost the volume and the sneaker also the screen Was damageI purchased this in february so i have no longer garanty but i think this post Will help to futures owners Have been happy with it. service was great, iPhone is a 4, all I could afford, and slow compared to my 4g. Still, I like the phone. Great product. Everything as expected After being a happy android user for years I decided to make the switch to this phone. I am very happy with the build quality. The screen is bigger than my nexus 4 with nice color Just one word: Wow! I like this phone for the larger buttons for texting. It works well in the holder I have and it is not cumbersome. Perfect as a work phone. You are better off with two cans and a string!!!! This is the WORSE phone ever! The first one I thought was a glitch. It was horrible. Kept closing out in the middle of conversation, battery would not hold and after receiving so many emails would get warnings that it was too much and couldn\\'t process?? Blah, blah, blah... so I sent it back and got a replacement. It stays on, emails work fine and the battery is great. THAT\\'s it. You have NO memory because it has SO many apps that are permanent - you don\\'t have a choice - that take up all the memory!!! But wait you say, you bought a 8 and it has dual sim capability. ME TOO. So I bought a sim, installed it but NOTHING can be transferred to it because there is NOTHING on the stupid phone to direct you to switch over. So I got a 30 ready and willing but unable to use. What you say, the instruction booklet is one the permanent apps? You are right! But under Dual Sim is says, you have one. Next subject!!! The instructions are non-existent, the dual sim is worthless, the dump kiddy apps that are permanent are ridiculous for an adult. This is my second third BLU. The first two were great but now out of stock. This one is of NO USE. Yes, Campbell Soup, here I come! I absolutely hate this phone. It works pain-stakingly slow. Going from one app to another takes about a minute. Also sometimes the keyboard wont show up times when I\\'m trying to input information. Lastly, all the apps crash and its frustrating. I would Excellent!!! excellent smartphone Phone didn\\'t work. Returned the item and never got money back Great phone?!!!!! very good phone This phone was ok at first but it keeps freezing and restarting. I\\'ve only had it for about 3 days now. Haven\\'t downloaded anything or added any service yet. Its just factory mess up\\'s causing it to have issues I guess. Still not happy about this though. Excelent. recommended 100% exelente gracias WORK PERFECTLY! Nokia needs to add some assembly required. The SIM card slot comes with the package, not installed in the phone. It is not a big deal and it is simple to install, even if you think you cannot install it you can, even if you refuse to install it your service provider will install it. The card slot takes 5 - 10 seconds to install; however the problem is this:When you purchase this type of phone it is never purchased by itself. There are screen protectors and cases that go with it. In general people do not read instruction manuals for phones, unless of course there is a message of some assembly required.Other than the card slot, this is an incredible phone. The apps are growing every day, between Nokia, Microsoft, and AT&T (my service provider) I have 3 industry leading companies providing me service. Here is the bottom line even with is type of OS in it\\'s infancy google will never beat Microsoft, Nokia has been an industry standard since inception and as for Bell laboratories they have an incredible track record for engineering and innovation. When you buy technology you go with leaders not imitators. This was not an unlocked T Mobile phone-I have to call to get them to unlock it-I am just throwing it away. Buyer Beware Do not Buy! Just throw your money else-ware. This phone is the best phone anyone could ever want I will never go back to Samsung Meet your expectations. Overall is a great phone, I am huge Windows OS fan. Was able to upgrade to 8.1 immediately which was a huge plus. However, on the first day the phone locked up and had to hard reboot it. I have dropped it only 2 times on carpet, sometimes it gets really hot and freezes randomly. The features are great, love the yellow. I just bought and I love it.The screen is really crisp. It is a great phone overall. HAD TO RETURN IT Very very cheap phone..u get what u pay for it works fine until the cursor starts going bad. getting stuck and not allowing selection. since it\\'s not easy to transfer data from 1 unit to another, i got stuck with it. now i really have to replace it. Excelente TOTAL WASTE OF MY MONEY! PHONE NEVER WORKED A DAY! LOUD NOISE WHENEVER YOU TRY TO MAKE A CALL! FACTORY DEFECT! USELESS! PLEASE DO BETTER SELLER! I have never had a smart phone before and I absolutely love this. It came so quickly and is absolutely a blast to use. Thank you. Worked great ! Was easy to get on a prepaid card and switched carriers with no fuss. COOL Watch ! The phone dials numbers while I try to backspace. Their is also a glitch in the screen. Also the phone screen goes blank Excellent. Incredible device for the price, one seller (cellstore33) has YOUR back. Exceptional!I\\'m extraordinarily happy with my product. It was listed as \"Very Good\" condition, but I would consider it \"Like New.\" Not a single blemish on the item. Extremely high quality at a fair market price. Exact match for the product description.Some people hate Android skins, but I love the little touches of HTC Sense. Media streaming (DLNA) built in, a great music player, car mode triggered by dock\\'s hardware cable, lock screen optimizations, flip for speakerphone, and all kinds of other small optimizations for Android. These really make for a superior user experience.If you ever have an issue on an order from cellstore33, rest assured they will bend over backwards to solve it. The shipping carrier for never registered a scan for the original tracking number, even after a week. Within a half hour of contacting the seller, I had a response that a replacement was in stock and would be sent out that same day. No fuss, no pushing necessary, no trying to further chase the original before helping me. My needs as a customer came first, and indeed the replacement shipped out that day. I received a personal email as soon as it shipped.Furthermore, as part of solving the problem, the seller proposed a generous remedy for my inconvenience. The seller then checked in twice more before delivery to make sure my needs were being taken care of. Once more afterwards to make sure I was satisfied. If an issue comes up, what more could you ask for?Given the attentiveness, extraordinary service, and generous remedy received when something went wrong, I would not hesitate to order again from this seller. If I have a friend searching for an unlocked device down the road, I know exactly where I will send them. I was ok, hated it for me though, I sold it for a lot less then I had paid for it, seems like a lot of people did not like it either. Oh well you live, buy and learn from your experiences I start by saying, I love the screen its large enough for me to see with glasses or without glasses. Everything else us great, except you have to wait for the United States networking to kick in, because it\\'s shipped from Hong Kong everything doesn\\'t work properly at first. But after twentyfour hours it\\'s all foid A+++++ Excellent product and I really liked my expectation filled the qualify because everything arrived as requested I really I liked all the pretty enough to recommend to all the community through Amazon not change. excelente The phone gets really hot. I had to program it myself in order for it work on my network (ATT) The quality of the phone is excellent . the speed is very good. Overall the phone is awesome. My only complaint is that when I received it the seal on the phones box was all ready opened and ther was all ready a screen protector installed on the phone. So I believe it had been used and returned before it was sold to me That\\'s good ítem definitely unlocked and works well in my country. Teléfono bonito, pero de baja calidad, pixeles muertos, botón en mal funcionamiento, software se pega al transferir datos, cámara muy mala. No lo recomiendo.Nice phone, but low quality, dead pixels, button malfunction, software sticks to transfer data, very bad camera. Would not recommend Bought this phone for my teenager after getting tired of spending ridiculous amounts of money on the \"latest and greatest\". I have had no regrets. The iPhone has worked great and saved me hundreds of dollars over the price of the latest iPhone. very good It is a good phone if you want to get away from the technology of the smart phone. Works well. Not worth it at all; the only thing it is good for is...nothing...don\\'t waste your money. It doesn\\'t have the memory it says it does, the battery drains in like under an hour, not a good choice at all. Awesome phone new in box WOW, WOW, WOW...I\\'m so terribly disappointed with is purchased! I decided to give this as a Christmas gift for that special woman in my life however a good deed, thought and gift has turned into a nightmarish experience. I\\'m not sure if it\\'s Samsung\\'s fault for not having better measures in place to prevent false CHINESE copies of their phones leaking into their inventory or if it\\'s a planned ploy to get over on less educated customers. Also I think Amazon hold companies passing off fakes via their website to the highest level of responsibility because it does affect one\\'s thought towards making future purchases of certain items.Yesterday after opening this gift my loved one plugged it up to charge the battery as anyone would do, but when we return later that evening I noticed immediately there was a problem when the recharge light was still red. So I unplugged it, removed the battery for 1 minute, and revered the process again, but there was no change for it appeared as though the phone wouldn\\'t charge. My lady unplugged the phone and powered it up, but she couldn\\'t get past the \"Language Selection\" menu which was English (UK) ONLY so she asked me to look at it. I attempted to navigate through the phone without any success. When I pressed start the phone did nothing and when I hit the power button the phone shown only \"Turn Off and Restart\", but wouldn\\'t do either when selected, so I had to remove the battery to shut it down.The next morning after breakfast I started doing online research into the problem after booting the phone to the Android ROM upgrade window. First before entering that screen a window appeared and all of the characters were written in Chinese versus Korean. As a veteran that have served overseas I can clearly distinguish many of the Asian languages from one another especially Korean which is more distinctive. Also I work as an IT Specialist and have been in the field for over 20 years. I downloaded the latest versions of Kies and Smart Switch, but neither software would recognize the phone and at that point my suspicion grew even more. I started conducting a search online of the \"ODIN MODE - Product Name: SM-G9006V\" and then is when I discovered I\\'d received an ETREMELY well made and PROFESSIONALLY packaged CHINESE made SAMSUNG GALAXY S5 knock-off!I\\'m glad the events that occurred happened otherwise if everything had functioned as it should have I\\'d probably NEVER EVER known I\\'d purchased a Chamsung Calaxy S5! No offense to anyone Chinese!I\\'ve added photos to substantiate my claims. Amazon please post this for it would be in the companies best interest to let other prospective buyers beware. I want to give SAMSUNG and Amazon a fair chance at righting this VERY WRONGFUL act before taking to social media. I like it a lot thanks Blu Studio C Mini Quad Core, I had this phone for over 3 months now ,totally disappointed and unsatisfied ...it doesn\\'t connect to data! ,doesn\\'t download media messages! or any attachment like contact ,file ....,doesn\\'t connect to wifi in free wifi places! can\\'t return it now ...totally waste of money ! It says unlocked but you cannot use for GSM carriers.they try to convince that you can but it will not work. very good phone. The only problem is that most apps are not made to work with windows. A way to force people to use android and apple products which are not better than this windows phone. nothing to say. worst device ever. This item works as described but I have become accustomed to a more advanced user interface on a cell phone. love it it bad i get everything they say i would no bull i would recommend this phone to anyone. excellent Phone was just used as a replacement until new phone could be purchased. It was ok. It was a described. Good price. God smartphone! identical to Blu Advance 5.0, for the price you can not demand more, it is a good entry-level smartphone, large and bright screen, camera ok, nor has frontal flash as indicated by the publication, recommend it! Utterly disappointed. Didn\\'t even have the phone for 24hrs and it started shutting off automatically. Now it won\\'t even come on. I tried the 120sec forced turn on and that didn\\'t work. I love Sony phones, this is my 7th Sony and I can\\'t believe that this happened. I\\'ve found forums that say that the problem is the battery and it needs to be replaced. If I get the battery changed and the phone does the same thing, that\\'ll be $280.00+whatever the battery and installation costs, gone down the drain. I\\'m VERY DISAPPOINTED. I love my Samsung! It is just a great phone over all. It is a good size, not to big, not to little. Good sound quality. It has plenty of storage for music, videos and any apps you may want to add. Wonderful ,quality phone delivered as promised ! I am completely satisfied ! I love it. And it works with Metro PCS. Yay. Good Phone. I mean great one, but if you\\'re looking for battery life, don\\'t buy it. It last like four hours for a busy woman like me. very good Bluetooth wouldn\\'t connect to anything. Constant error messages. Wouldn\\'t show pictures that I took using the camera. Sent it back for a refund. It\\'s a little bit difficult to use the Android sys at first time. But when I am familiar wiz it, I\\'d like to use it every time. Good quality, nice sounds, fast sys and multiple apps. it a great phone for its price.I have no problem with it.its great for playing games and watching videos and movies.the camera is not that bad,but also not good.i dont take alot of pics so i dont care.the speaker is not that loud.my iPhone 4 i have was louder that it.the headphones that came with it work great.i have no problems talking and texting on it.i think some day iPhone will probably make there phones this big. Works great had some trouble getting my data to work at first but all good now It\\'s has almost the same features like the other brand name phones such as the Samsung galaxy Love it!!! Came in excellent condition!!! This a great phone I\\'ve brought this because I was looking for a budget phone and this phone meets my needs. The problem I\\'m having is the bluetooth goes out for a second when streaming music which is a bummer since I\\'m a music lover. Another thing is the volume is extremely low as others have said when using speaker or just talking on it. This is the reason I gave it 3 stars. The iPhone heats up & battery dies too fast & I only had it for 2 weeks, supposed to be new but it don\\'t seem like it. From internal conditions. looks great, don\\'t work great:( Excellent Nice Blacberry, its a nice and cheap blackberry i used in very hard working conditions and i have it for a year or so, its very durable. Had nice functions, wi-fi, and work international Phone and battery was in really good shape but the charger and back casing could be better would have been 5 stars on another note phone works with TMOBILE 4G lte with the correct APN settings I was so excited to recieve my 32gb black iPhone 4s! It was delivered within 2 days which made me extremely happy as well. However when I opened the box I found a white iPhone. Not a big deal. I switched the phone over with ease and everything was perfect. Until I realized it wasnt a 4s either. I already had a white iPhone 4, why would I want another one??? I am so dissapointed. I called amazon and they recommended I just get a refund. Now I have to send back the phone I was so excited to get, and order another phone, probably from ebay. Cool. This will be the last time I order from Amazon for a while. This phone doesn\\'t stay charged and when the battery gets low it will not send text without notification the text didn\\'t send. Has cause major headaches!! Sorry I got rid of my other phone, it worked much better than this one. Drops calls No issues, phone performs well. Love it Despite giving the LG G4 3 stars, I did find it to be a mostly enjoyable experience. Here is a breakdown:Pros:+1080P images on the screen look excellent+The speaker on the phone is actually decent+Still uses the microUSB standard+The lock button is position on the back of the device. This is great because your hand naturally rests on the back and makes a quick and easy unlock+The camera is top notch! 16MP is pretty great on a phone and you will not be disappointed.+The leather backing is really nice to hold and gives a moderate amount of grip. Most days I go without a case because I love the leather.+Ability to change the battery and add a microSD card! I missed the ability to upgrade my storage from when I had a Galaxy S5.Cons-The backing pops off every time I remove a case from my phone and I am afraid it will break every time-The LG UI is pretty restrictive by Android standards, though I was pleased to see Marshmallow 6.0 out of the box.-The battery is pretty bad. This is one of the biggest reasons I gave the LG G4 a 3 star rating, and why I ultimately got rid of it.-Sometimes Apps bug or crash. I am sure this is just a software issue as the G4 has pretty good specs besides.-The screen is very dark. This was also a big concern for me because in the summer time here in Alaska, we have sunlight most of the day and damn it\\'s bright!Overall:The LG G4 was an excellent phone besides the lacking battery life and low brightness screen. For $300 it is a great buy and it even comes unlocked! has been a good buy, since the phone is lightweight, inexpensive and with the necessary functions to capitalize, delivery was on time, no problem with the product arrived in good condition, flawless, thanks Works great!!!! I would recommend this company to anybody for purchases they make! I have no problems at all with this phone! Worked: RAM increase, faster downloads I already had an Iphone 5C but it only had 8GB of storage. I needed much more. I ordered this phone, it came earlier than expected. It was fully functional and had no problems. It also looks brand new. I\\'ve owned this now for a few months and everything is working fine. It offers plenty of storage. It was a good deal for the price. Great I wanted this phone for a long time because I thought it was cute.Horrible phone. The touch screen is, for lack of a better word, wonky. Very unresponsive. Great phone!!!!! Its definitely a keeper I bought this item in december and shipping was fast. Never experienced any problems with the phone up to now its been great! Thumbs up! Good product I\\'m loving it! Fantastic phone! It wish it had NFC so I could do Google pay or set up a few commands. It doesn\\'t bother me much although it is slightly counter intuitive that the fingerprint sensor doesn\\'t double as a home button.The phone is fast. It is super responsive. It takes a 128GB SD card! I LOVE IT! Very good The phone arrived very quickly, and it works really well with my T-Mobile network, it was an effortless transition from an iPhone. You get that you pay Awesome If you\\'re getting this phone to use your provider\\'s wifi calling - don\\'t! It will not work. For tmobile subscribers this is critical since they often have poor reception in certain areas. Of course you can download 3rd party wifi calling apps, but you wont be able to make/receive calls using your own phone number. If you don\\'t need wifi calling - then it is a fine deal. EXCELLENT PHONE!!! I\\'m actually considering purchasing another on of these phones. Perfect size, not to big. Screen is clear. Excellent cover and screen protector comes with the phone. 32 GB of memory I have over 2500 songs saved on this phone. Great phone for a good price, i was surprise when i reviced the phone its big and it works greats. love it, love it Phone is very good, I use skype all the time without any issue. Excellent relation between price and quality. Totally recommend it! Have my Nokia E7-00 for two weeks now...and loving every moment of it...In the beginning I couldn\\'t access OVI store or set up emails but after I emailed Nokia , those features started working the next day. Five stars for the keyboard..easy to text and very durable..just open it from the side edges and youre fine...great security features overall best phone i\\'ve had to date. EXCELENTE excelente Great! I\\'ve owned HTC phones before so I knew what to expect and they didn\\'t disappoint. I especially.love how high the volume is when watching videos or listening to music. Graphics are clear too. Camera pictures are clean and crisp. Stores lots of movies. Awesome! I returned it no problem with it splendid product I upgraded to the iPhone 6 when it came out (I needed to test a few apps on the larger screen) and then last year I thought, \"If I get the Plus, I can have an even better reading/watching experience\". After 6 months, I\\'m ditching my 6S+ and I\\'m loving this phone! It\\'s so small and light it almost feels like a toy, and I don\\'t need a case to keep from dropping it. i got as unlocked phone. Just nice. thanks In summary the Nokia E71 is a high end voice/video/messaging communication device it is not to be confused with a web viewing or gaming device.For some odd reason Nokia phones have never been that popular in the USA in comparison to Europe and Australasia. This model the E71-2 is made in Finland and is the unlocked (non carrier specific) US model version and has GSM/EGSM (GRPS EDGE) quad band 850/900/1800/1900 MHz and uses 850/1900 MHz for UTMS/WCDMA (high speed data packet access HSDPA aka 3G)[...]. So what you ask? Basically, with the US model if you travel overseas don\\'t expect to receive UMTS (3G) service.The Nokia E71 is best called a high end business smartphone....kind of like those high-end German cars it has more bells and whistles than any other smartphone on the market and just like those high-end German cars (designed by engineers for engineers!) you will need to read the manual and play around with all of the buttons to work out all the features it has to offer. The Nokia uses the Symbian (competitor to Android and iPhone) operating system and has a relatively large number of applications that will run on the phone. All of the currently popular applications are available for the phone Skype, Facebook, Youtube etc. Many of the apps can be directly downloaded from Nokia\\'s \"Ovi Store\" using the app directly from the phone.The phone has a built in FM radio that works great, but you will need the headset to be plugged in (it acts as the antenna), but once plugged in you can use the loudspeaker. The audio is very good and plenty loud when using it with all the audio applications. The phone has a built in GPS receiver and now has free Ovi maps (global set...you will need a large memory card if try and download them all) available from Nokai for download. The GPS works great and has a large voice set available also, my daughter loves the English Surfer Dude speaker. Phone has infrared, bluetooth and wifi connectivity built in.The wifi works well and is a great feature at home or on the road. I can web surf and download podcasts (it has a podcast subscription app). The phone has an internet radio application that is also a great feature...you can listen to many US and intentional based internet radio stations like the BBC for free.I personally prefer to have a keyboard with my phones rather than a touch screen and like the Nokia for this reason, it is odd that I find it easier to type with the E71 keyboard than my work issued BlackBerry. The screen is about the same size as the BlackBerry screen, but Nokia have (in my opinion) could have worked better on using the real estate and particularly with the font and icon size on the home page. If you have bad eyesight you may find the E71 very hard to use without a magnifying glass.The good:1: High end unlocked smartphone for less that $230!!!! (not locked to a carrier or plan)2: Unlocked phone has many phone carrier defeating applications. VOIP/SIP and wifi3: Phone supports cell/phone calls, video camera calls (has both forward facing and rear facing camera), internet (VOIP/SIP) calls in native application, Skype, Fring calls...4: Applications galore included.5: Ovi store applications and GPS maps for free.6: Phone is lightweight.7: Battery life is great and is user replaceable.8: Phone will multi-task without any issues, listen to the radio, web surf and download all at the same time.The bad:1: Phone almost requires a degree to operate.2: Too many menu options and levels to achieve tasks.The ugly:1: Text size and phone icons (3g, signal/battery bars) are miniscle.2: Phone requires a PhD to totally master.3: PC based Ovi/PC suite sync application is slooooooooooooooooow.I\\'m using the phone with a $6.99 for 90 days T-Mobile prepaid SIM card and have setup a VOIP/SIP account along with Google Voice for voice mail and free wifi internet calling. Life is good. Very odd but my teenage daughter would rather have my E71 than an iPhone.Overall the E71 is a great communication device with many great features included for the price. If you are looking for a cheaper phone then have a look at the Nokia E63 as an option, it does not have a GPS receiver, forward video camera or external volume controls. But is a tougher phone with all the other attributes of the E71 above. For about $159 you can find a new unlocked with US warranty supported E63. as advertised Received incorrect case with phone. Phone OS will not be updated to Android 5, even though the phone was released in December 2014. Phone constantly resets to factory setting whenever you power off phone, Worst phone every owned. Unable to received email and or messages at time. Phone constantly freezes when using. After owning this phone for 90 days I can honestly say this is the worst smartphone I have ever used. The battery life is horrible! It will go from 100 to 45 in just 30 minutes on standby. It will even lose charge and die if you use it while charging. The camera is so-so. It only comes with a handful of tricks. I like that BLU was doing something different with WP but I still have not received windows 10 Mobile yet. I understand the phone is cheap but please just save your money for a mid-range galaxy. I haven\\'t received anything. Frankly, the calling to get reimbursed or see why the phone hasn\\'t arrived is not worth my time. Bought this for my husband. He does love it, however it drains his phone too much and too fast. Great Buy! Delivered on time. Product received as described. Very Good Phone!!! the order bill its no present whit my cell phone? i need the bill for complete the order. its the one Yes it works great So far so good phone works great no problems. Only thing is that I didnt know you had to switch out to a mini sim card which was no problem getting one though very good for this price Nice, beautyfull even with the SIM card al the features, such as receiving pictures are not available and attaching pictures to facebook etc. Not a very user friendly phone. All the apps act differently. I would not by an out of network phone again. I will stick to what my provider actually offers even if its limited as at least all the features work the way they are supposed to. it very good i am working with it in Egypt on all the networks and it with 50 % of the price Just to clarify, since at the time I\\'m writing the review, the thumbnail icon is different from the product picture on the page: This product is for a hard shell case for the LG Optimus S LS670, it\\'s white with a black spiral pattern.It\\'s a hard material and snaps in place. It\\'s good protection while it lasts, but one of the times my phone fell, it broke part of the case that is needed to fasten the two sides together. It also seems to have made my phone run warmer than it would normally.However, for the price and considering the phone is now quite outdated, it\\'s not bad. Awesome phone Since I\\'ve been using this phone which is about a month, I have never had Amy major issues with it . it has a nice audio, resolution, fast sensitivity to touch, camera both front and back. The only minor faults i have with it is its lack of multitasking and not adjust to light background for the camera. Except for that, it is really nice and durable because lord knows how many times I\\'ve dropped this phone in over a month and it still works adequately. I would highly recommend this phone to any buyer I would not buy a BLU phone again. This phone lasted a little over a year before the battery stopped working properly. I would have paid for a replacement battery but BLU customer service said that the company does not offer replacement batteries and the third-party vendors and Web sites that they referred me to did not have batteries in stock for this model and did not foresee getting them in stock in the future. A few Web sites claim to have compatible batteries but we do not know yet if they will work in this phone. I wanted a basic phone, and this phone filled that purpose for a year (though the camera on the phone was definitely sub-standard). But I do not buy many electronics and I do not want the few that I do buy to turn into garbage in just a little over a year\\'s time. Great price and it does everything I need it to do! It didn\\'t come with a American Charger and the reception is awful.. The only way I can download is on wifi, without wifi its useless. Check and make sure youre not buying a international version because they aren\\'t nor do they work the same because the international system runs on true 4G> in America we use 4G LTE google it theres a difference that\\'s why it dosent work properly. I hate to send it back because is a beautiful phone but there\\'s nothing I can do with it I\\'m giving 2 stars because I actually like the phone itself. Bought this to hold my work ID and MetroCard so i wouldnt have to carry anything else on my daily commute. They both fit perfectly inside even with the mirror insert. RFID card access still works through this case, although the case has to come pretty close to the reader to be registered. Bought a new phone (not used or refurbished). Beautiful phone. Looks sleek and modern. Came with a free case and screen protector. Powered off with no problem. Clean layout, easy navigation. I was in love with this phone. However, after a few days, the blue screen of death appeared and the phone would not shut off. After taking out and re-inserting the battery, the phone started to work as normal. A few more days later, I got another blue screen of death. This time, the phone powered itself down and could not be turned on again. I had to return it.I really, really wanted to love this phone. It\\'s affordable and looks beautiful. I wonder if I got a lemon. I\\'m debating on whether or not to give it another try and purchase another one. Maybe second time is a charm? So bad This phone was refurbished but still worked perfectly! There were a few noticeable scratches and scuffs on the back of the phone, but nothing a good case couldnt take away. Nothing was wrong with the phone and was exactly what I was expecting for $150. A very good deal indeed Great mobile phone! I like this phone. It is rugged, feels great in your hands, is smaller than most phones with equivalent cases to the S5 Active\\'s built in form, and has about as good a battery as the S4. Also, seems pretty fast and handles fast internet speeds well. (got up to the max 6 Mbs/s of my home wifi with a particularly decent download source a few times, and phone still handled internet browsing, watching youtube, etc., without issue) I did not like the phone at all. I bought it less than a month and I can not hear the person who is calling me. Very disappointed!!! Not bad at all Thanks thata great The phone is great, good size, internationally ready and it works great for my Christmas present There seems to be a lot of functions on the watch. But the manual is vague at best.If your going to put in only name and # for the phone, I recommend you put it to the sim card. Twice now, we lost data that was saved to the watch, not sure why. It is supposed to have voice command capability, but could not get it to recognize any command.if you turn on voice for phone numbers to be audible, it only speaks in Chinese, no matter what language is selected.The plus side, calls a crisp and clear on the receiving end, and the speaker option to the watch is hard to hear. The MP 3 player is good with the included ear buds(only way mp3\\'s can be played). The stylus is neatly tucked in the band, and does not slip out.The watch will accept a 16GB micro SD card. it keeps time well and can choose time as a screen saver, and then just tap the screen for it to display. I actually bought this for my Wife, so she could have an easily accessible Phone that was easy to use and out of the way. and can be used quickly in an emergency. The battery life is good, and it comes with a spare battery. It is a good price when you consider you get blue tooth ear phone and charging cable, ear buds, two batteries, charging unit for phone and blue tooth( can only charge one at a time.) I have never reviewed a product before but with the blue Studio 5.5 see it worked great for a couple of months and then it just quit it won\\'t connect to wierdly right after the return policy went up.... Dont buy Phone was probably fine, but would not work on Verizon. Seller gladly refunded the money. I brought my S5 about a week ago and didn\\'t purchase the insurance. I made sure to get a protective case to avoid any possible damage to my phone. I chose the purple and grey option and although the case is big the muted purple doesn\\'t look bad. I love it. Muy bueno I liked the look of this cell, it\\'s not as big as the new Pixel or Iphone though, but it\\'s not tiny either. I was looking for an unlocked cell that was under $100 and at first glance the RCA M1 seemed to fit, but out of the box it would not connect to our home WiFi. or it would say that my WiFi was \"out of range\", even when I was standing over my router and modem. After going through almost all of the comments and Q&A\\'s I found that it has an issue with the internal antenna and some have had to return their phone for a replacement. I contacted the seller and got a somewhat by the numbers response... Did I enter my password in right, have I contacted my service provider... That kind of thing. At this point I am using Cricket\\'s unlimited internet for all my needs. If I had went with a smaller data plan or with another carrier that did not offer unlimited data I also would have returned this phone for a refund. The only reason I give it 3 stars \\'it\\'s okay\\' rating is because of the work around I was able to get with the cricket internet and because I\\'m not returning the cell. It will work until I can afford a better phone. If you plan on buying this cell you should also know that the battery life is not that great about 5 to 7 hours with light usage. ie, Skype, Youtube, checking email and some txting. If using for music it\\'s a little better. You get what you pay for, I guess. Other than that it functions like any other smart phone. This phone is by far the absolute worst phone I have ever had- and I am not a picky person when it comes to phones. I tried multiple times to calibrate the touch screen, but it was never correct. It was absolutely impossible to dial a number using the touch screen because when I would hit a number another would be entered (sometimes I would type \"8\" and \"2\" would appear\"). I found myself in tears from the simple task of trying to call my grandmother. The battery life was what caused me to get another phone... it lasted 2 hours on a good day. Many times I was stranded on the side of the road and forced to walk through snow, sleet, and hail to reach my destination because my phone could not remain on long enough to perform it\\'s basic function- call for help. The picture quality was terrible. I have a dog with white fur and black spots. The pictures are so blurry that my dog appears as a gray blob with a tail. Oftentimes the screens would simple freeze and I would have to remove the battery in order to use the phone. This would usually cause me to launch the phone across the room due to frustration, which proves to be quite humiliating while in class, meetings, or other professional settings. Also, sometimes I would simply set the phone down and the battery would pop out! I literally could not believe what was happening. I had to put the battery back in the phone and then power on the device. 15 seconds of my life... GONE! Once I turned the phone on to find all of my preferences (background, password, text themes, etc) were replaced. I still can\\'t explain that one. I did not bother to reset my preferences- it was not worth the hassle. Instead I smashed the thing to smithereens and invested in a DROID. It was a cheap phone and barely served as a suitable replacement for the 3 months that I could bear to use the thing. I lost a lot of sleep, hair, and bodily fluids over this phone and would not wish it on my worst enemy. The phone is good I love my phone but it took some time learning how to use it but now I can\\'t live without it. Thanks for delivering the phone in good condition and fast delivery. this phone is fake we can not even use it for one week . i will nenever again buy this product This phone stop working in 2 days! Love this phone. Bought it for my kids to take on vacation out of the country and it works very very well! I can\\'t get the thing to sync with my phone. I even watched several Youtube videos on how to do it and still can\\'t figure it out. Can\\'t find the sound to turn it down or off. Can\\'t pull up the apps section most of the time. Sending it back. Don\\'t waste your money! ___I have owned every iPhone since the 3G model. Every year for 7 years I have upgraded. In my household is a slew of Apple products from iPad’s, MacBook’s to iPhones. My household now has 3 new iPhone 7 models. But I am also a bigtime Android owner with several high end Android phones and tablets from various manufactures. The thing is, my family loves high end tech and appreciates quality regardless of brand, make or model.I follow the mobile tech world religiously and stay abreast of all new technologies and products from all companies, big and small. I watched the Keynote on September 7th live and listened to Apple pitch the iPhone 7. I pre-ordered the 7 at 3am EST on the 9th so I could have it in my hands on the 16th.But then I came to a realization about the 7 and 7 Plus that struck a chord with me. All the new tech on the 7 is not new at all, in fact has been on several phones in some cases since 2011. I also realized that the tech inside the 7 only matches mid-range android versions. If you take the Apple logo off the back and re-brand this under Android, it would not be a $770-$970 device but a $350-$550 device given the hardware and features it has. In fact, Apples net cost on the 256GB 7 Plus is only $226 yet retails for $970. This is disturbing to me, not just the 403% profit margin, but the whole effort into making an average iPhone for today’s standards. Apple use to be a leading-edge company with innovations that took the industry by storm. Today, in 2016, Apple no longer excites me. Sure the integration between software and hardware is not matched by any tech company today but the gap is rapidly bridging. At such a premium price, I think after this version, considering there is nothing innovative about it and retails for double what other companies offer, has me moving away from Apple in 2017. I don’t know about you, but the old saying goes the bigger you are the harder you fall. Bye bye Apple, time for a divorce.___Update 9/22/2016: In response to criticism about my review:___Apple certainly raised the bar on smartphones and has kept that bar up. My expectations are high for the iPhone and as such when they are not met, as with the iPhone 7/7 Plus, my letdown is all that much harder. The IPhone 7/7 Plus are great phones do doubt, but do I think they are $970 great? Certainly not. Apple (could have) done so much better with the iPhone 7 and didn\\'t. That is my letdown.When it comes to raw processing power Apple wins in controlled and application tests. But in 2016/17 nearly all phones are fast enough, heck even the iPhone 5s of 4 years ago is fast enough, but today, shaving milliseconds off app switching times or load times goes beyond the human brains capacity to keep up. It\\'s not about pure brawns, ecosystems, cultures, or social image, it\\'s about value and making life\\'s tasks easier.Apples multi-million dollar 12 step polishing process to get the Jet black phone to shine is not nearly as important as making it available at affordable prices and offering cutting edge features that make my whole reason for existing plausible.If I walked into my Honda dealer and saw the new 2017 Accord had a price tag of $110,000 I would walk out immediately, it\\'s about value. Even if the Accord blew the doors off its competition I still walk because its value is lost.Truth of the matter is even India\\'s $4 phone gets the job done, and that\\'s a fact.Lets examine the iPhone 7/7 Plus components.CPU:The A10 Fusion chip in the Apple 7’s is manufactured by TSMC, (Samsung made the A9 chips in the 6s). It is a quad-core 16nm big.LITTLE soC running at 2.34GHz tops, 1.3GHz nominal with 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM, (2GB on the 4.7- inch version). Similar chips and even more powerful quad-core, hexi-core and even octa-core chips run in various far less expensive phones using 4GB to 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM running in dual channel mode. The one thing Apple does do extremely well is manage its RAM which is all software based. The Linux driven Android software has not got there yet. Yes, this is an advantage Apple currently holds over the competition but one that is vastly slipping away.LCD:The LCD panel is also on level with submarket phones. The LPIPS 1080 panel is rated at 401P, 1300:1 contrast, (1400:1 on the 4.7 inch), 625nits and P3 Cinematic color gamut at 125%. Let’s examine this. With the exception of the P3 color gamut, every $200 and above phone has this or better. I can list a slew of phones all under $300 that have LPIPS, (or even better OLED), 1080 FHD, 1500:1 to infinite contrast ratio, 500-700nits and sRGB color gamut at 100%. The Neo-LPIPS panel supplied on Huawei products is nearly as excellent as the S-AMOLEDS produced by Samsung and supplied on phones starting at $150. Apple has been in talks with Samsung about supplying s-AMOLED panels for the iPhone for 3 years, I believe the iPhone 8 will receive this panel next year. The cinematic P3 rating and higher brightness output (nit) was given to the iPhone 7’s to help make the photos pop on-screen better.CAMERA:The Bokeh effects of the dual camera system on the 7 Plus can easily be duplicated in Post with software. I won’t argue and say the camera implementation on the iPhone 7’s is not excellent, sure it is. But the Leica dual camera system on the P9 and Honor 8 are just as good and offered on devices that match or surpass other technical features and cost half as much. The camera system on the S7 is excellent too. LG has excellent implementations on the older G4, G5 and new V20. The LG G4 that can be had for $150, has a 2.1GHz hexi-core CPU, 3GB RAM, 5.5-ich QHD screen, 32GB on board memory, 128GB SD slot, and a 16MP camera that shoots in RAW and even by today’s standards is excellent shooter.SOFTWARE:With iOS 10 we can now delete stock Apple apps. This is Apples way of saying they understand their app versions suck and no one uses them or want them. We can replace them with much better 3rd party versions that also happen to have equally good Android versions. In the 30 days iOS 10 has been on the iPhone 7, (9/16 to 10/12), it has had two major updates, v10.0.1 and v10.0.2. Let’s not forget the epic failure of the lightening headphones, Gallery App and extensions crashing. This is a bug fix every two weeks. Also in the 30 days I have owned my iPhone 7 I have had to perform two hard resets for Apple Apps locking and seizing up, one was Safari the other iMessages. At one point I had to get Apple support on the phone. In 2016/2017 Android v7.01 (and 6.0.1) are just as stable and efficient and maybe even more so, but my point is there is no advantage one over the other, at this stage it is simply a matter of personal preferences. We can’t argue that iOS is superior to Android because surely is not. With almost all apps being cross-platform functional communications between iOS and Android is now transparent and we can fully immerse in both worlds without any effects.SAMSUNG:I have given the same review about Samsung products. Samsung is by no means the Messiah of Android. Their products are matched or outdone with less expensive variants as well. Samsung will have a very difficult time recovering from their $1B fiasco this year. When a company starts selling of its stock interest and shares on partner companies and liquidating core assets you know they are in trouble.STORAGE:The reason Apple does not offer external SD storage is twofold. One, the SD license is held by Microsoft and Apple would have to pay royalties to Microsoft in order to use it. Apple will never pay royalties to any company – royalties are paid to Apple not the other way around. Two, Apple would lose control over file sharing.APPLE TRIVIA - DID YOU KNOW:Did you know the iPhone has many Samsung components? Samsung has made the CPU/GPU for several generations of iPhones. This year with the 7 Samsung supplies the RAM chips and ROM chips. Samsung is rumored to supply its s-AMOLED screens next year for the iPhone 8.Did you know Google pays Apple $100 million/year to have Google set as the default search for Safari? Google also pays Apple a percentage for every click too.Did you know Google invests more money and R&D for its iOS apps over its own Android counterparts? Apps like Hangouts, Google Maps, Chrome, Google Now etc., get updates and new releases before its own native Android versions.Did you know that Amazon hosts the iCloud storage for Apple? Amazon is the largest cloud host in the world providing several companies with its AWS servers. Apple pays Amazon hundreds of millions of dollars every year for its cloud servers.Did you know Apple refused to pay Corning its royalties to use the Gorilla Glass name so calls its glass ‘Ionized strengthened’ even though it is Corning Gorilla glass version 4.Did you know the iPhone 6/6s also has water resistant features? Apple never published or made public this feature for liability reasons but the 6/6s has resins and glues inside to protect vital components from water damage. If you have ever dropped your 6/6s in water usually within a couple hours its up and running at 100%.___Thank you for reading___ THE ONLY THING IS THAT I DO NOT READ CHINESSE. SO THE NAVIGATOR And other stuff are in chinesse . and I can not understand them. but by the phone is great. only the software programming shuld be alllllll in english. since it is for an american user. This LG G3 is fast and the screen is beautiful!I will reconfirm that the 4G will not work in the US on cricket wireless (AT&T network). But the 3G connection is plenty fast enough for my needs and I wanted a 1440p screen for under $300 that was also unlocked.Having both a user replaceable battery and expandable storage is excellent for users who would like to keep there phone for longer than a year.Battery life is good easily lasting throughout the day with average use.Software updates could be more frequent, this phone is still on android 5.0. Rumor has it that 6.0 will be released to the G3 but we\\'ll have to wait and see.The LG software overlay is very functional and doesn\\'t detract from the experience whatsoever.The camera takes excellent photos and is extremely fast to focus. The camera is beyond what most will ever need in a smartphone,You can even use this phone as a remote control but this feature isn\\'t the greatest due to the poor range.I think this is still the only phone available with a 1440p screen in this price range and the extra GB of ram on the international version is appreciated. I recommend buying a glass screen cover to protect the beautiful screen. As a first time iPhone owner I can\\'t say why this phone is better than another. But I will thus far, i am impressed with my new [to me but used] iPhone 4S. Pictures are great, seems to be a decent speed for running applications. Even the ios7 seems to work good. The only drawback, like most phones, especially used, is the battery life. But overall I enjoy my Verizon Wireless Apple IPhone 4S. Excelente First of all the phone was not an iPhone 3GS , it is an iphone 3G instead.#2 I could not activate it for some reason by connecting it with iTunes , I\\'ve tried dozens of time unsuccessfullyDon\\'t trust this buyer , all they care about is getting customers money I love my cell phone, and I think it was the best deal I ever had in buying a phone. JUST WHAT I WANTED. FANTASTIC I am disappointed as this phone is less than a month old and it hangs quite often. I have bought so many products in the last two months in amazon and this is the most disappointing one. the phone is just awesome, it is the best phone in the world you will never find better than this, only the problem was too late shipping and very expensive. Its not one of the affordable price. I am loving this phone and all the wonderful features. Fabulous!!!!! Many games caused the phone to halt, and then after 1 month new bugs started to pop up.The touch screen is not responding anymore, phone is turned on only if connected to the chargerhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004N861MG/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title I like my new watch. I can tell time, make and take phone calls, listen to my Rhapsody music that I download away from home. Loving it so far, my only problem I listen to music all the time with a Bluetooth head set, the battery is down to about 15% after about 6 hours of continuous listening. I wish the battery would last longer, but no worries it still like my new watch.update: 11-1-15Play Store, Google Keep, Gmail, MS One Note, wow!update 12-23-15received my Soundbot SB250 and my bluetooth keyboard\\xa0Blue Wind Palm-size Mini Rechargeable Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard for IOS (iPad & iPad mini & Iphone) Android(Lenovo IdeaTab A8-50 8-Inch,Dell Venue 8,Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 8.0 T715 / tab A 8.0 T350 Note S3 S4 S5 and Other Android Devices) Windows(Microsoft Surface /ASUS VivoTab 8/Nokia Lumia 2520/Dell Venue 8 Pro/ASUS VivoTab RT/HP Stream 8/Toshiba Encore 2 WT8/HP Stream 7/ Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet 2 And Other Windows 8 Devices) ,Black\\xa0making this a great pair. I use the keyboard to control my Rhapsody. The Soundbot SB250 works as headphones or speaks that is great too. :-) The phone was ultimately good, only bad fact is .that it didnt come with a case and after 4 days of use the white began chipping. but it works well, good camera for the price and flash. The android os works fast and allows for the download of all the apps desired with google play Thanks! Excellent As someone who just wants a good *small phone*, for making phone calls, I found myself buying this one because it was literally the only small phone I could find (the phone I replaced was a bar phone the size of a Chicklets box). Every other option available now is either a smart phone or cheap flip-phone garbage.So I chose this phone entirely for its size, not because it\\'s a smart phone (keyboard way too small to type on), and I was very pleasantly surprised at the call quality on the handset and when using bluetooth. I *DO* recommend this phone if you just want something small for making calls, but don\\'t get your hopes up.Having said that, you get what you pay for:- The pictures provided by the manufacturer are *very* misleading, showing a standard Android Launcher screen, when in fact this phone has a cheap, custom UX that tries and fails to look like iOS.- For no discernible reason, this custom UI doesn\\'t use Android standards — for example… - There is no Apps Tray, and instead all your apps are on your homescreen whether you like it or not - It has a Recent Apps button, but it\\'s inexplicably used for Settings instead - Recent Apps is instead found only by holding down the Home button- The paltry user guide has *no* instructions of any kind about this nonsense custom UI, so you\\'re completely on your own for figuring out stuff like how to reach Recent Apps, so good luck figuring out how to add widgets or rearrange the home screens (tap and hold on empty spot of Launcher)- Instead of using the perfectly fine Android Contacts app, there\\'s a custom contacts app that leaves a lot to be desired- You can\\'t edit or delete Contacts stored on your SIM card (but you can add new SIM contacts) - (You\\'ll have to download \"SIM Contacts\" by PenumbraApps from Play Store - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.penumbra.apps.SIM_Contacts_Manager- The maximum volume on the handset isn\\'t loud enough- The maximum volume on the speakerphone *really, really* isn\\'t loud enough- You can\\'t change lock screen background to pic — you\\'re stuck with what they give you- Because of screen size, keyboard is nearly impossible to type on - Download \"TouchPal,\" which is a) the best keyboard for Android anyway, b) allows you to resize it (I can type on this one)- Status bar shows mobile & wifi signal strength, but *doesn\\'t show bluetooth status* (again, silly custom UI) - However, there is a Power Control widget you can put on the home screen for that- The battery monitor is wildly inaccurate- If you keep your phone numbers on your SIM, the Direct Dial widget thinks *every* phone number is a mobile phone, and you can\\'t change it- The accelerometer is sketchy — when pulling phone down from face during call, screen comes on only about 1/10th of the time - Worse, power button doesn\\'t start up the screen during calls about 60% of the time eitherIf anyone else made decent small feature phones anymore, I probably wouldn\\'t have even looked at this one. But if you want a small phone with decent call quality, you\\'re pretty much stuck with this. Great phone for the price, nice camera and it runs smooth (with only 1 gb ram) It is good!! nice phone, as expected. The screen on this phone does not stay lit for very long, I have to keep hitting the button to get it to light up again. Its a pain when you are trying to do something. Phone came within 5 days with case included, along with the original box and samsung charger as well as headphones. BUY BUY BUY! Reall love this phone but the battery is terrible! And for some reason as others have said the WiFi and cell radio turn off on their own for no apparent reason. This really sucks as everything else about this phone is fantastic. Changing to 1 star because now the mic stopped working and no one can hear me. I am not the owner of it but I suspect everything is good. It was a gift for a lost soul.Delivery was as stated and on time as promised.Thank you guys so much and have a blessed 2015.Arnold Collins excellent smartphone parese good I have to use for product quality Meet the expected standard, I was very happy with the purchase. The phone was shipped overseas with an intention of shipping it back if it does not work as expected. fortunately enough it worked as advertised. Both ends happy everyone happy. I just wish the phones speaker was louder. Otherwise great product for the money. Works fantastic. Thank you! I believe I was purchasing a new - not refurbhished item. However, the phone has been problematic since it was activated. After a few months of use, it began to power itself down automatically after 5 to 20 minutes of use. It also didn\\'t hold a charge for very long. I took it to a recommended repair shop and the technician suggested that the battery could be bad. Upon opening the phone to change the battery, he discovered a somewhat bloated battery - indicating that it had probably been wet at one time. (I can attest that the phone has never been dunked!) He also said that \"stickers\" inside the case indicate that the phone was a refurbished one. I had never had it serviced before and as said, I thought I was buying a new phone. When I ordered, there was no indication to say it was not anything but new. Upon notifying the seller that I received a used/refurbished rather than a new phone, I received a canned reply that basically said I had 30 days from purchase to return the phone - a totally unsatisfactory answer. However, for $65 (plus tax) spent on a new battery, the phone now works well. I certainly would not buy from this dishonest provider again. Nice phone Perfect for my wife on puretalk program This thing is junk. You can\\'t open the app you have to install on phone. I absolutely love this smart phone! Bought an iPhone 4S and ended up returning it. The Android OS is way better than iOS, amazing apps! The phone quality is, too. The only weakness in the box is the manual. A blurry copy in small print, not helpful in anyway for a user standpoint. But as far as the phone goes, I am glad I made the right choice. I order a Samsung Galaxy S3. It was supposed to be CDMA Verizon and GSM unlocked but its not. Its locked to Verizon and I can\\'t get it activated to straight talk like i want. I will never order from this company again. The phone gas veena taken apart and has scratches on the back side of the screen. It is cracked in 3 places. It locks by itself and when i push unlock button it does nothing most of the time. I spent $150 on a piece of crap phone. The description said it was in great condition. I just want my money back or a better phone that is actually unlocked. I noticed the MOTO G PLUS in the prime days advertising. The OCTA CORE processor captivated me. After researching the processor it is true that there is no specific programs for 8 cores, The SNAP DRAGON PROCESSOR uses one quad core for low power programs and one for high power programs. Low power uses such as phone calls are routed through one quad core and gaming is routed through a high power core. the phone calls are clear and the games play well. I find the camera exceptionally capable and the HD features clear. I have not tried out all of the features, but there are so many. So far so good. Fantastic price point for the high quality. I bought this for my son and he loves his phone. I may even buy me one. It doesn\\'t come with the magnetic charging chip EXCELENT ALL I M HAPPY VERY THANKS PLEASE SEND ME INFO FOR MORE I HOPE WILL BE YOU CUSTOMER AGAIN SOON Highly recommend. Works great. The reception on this phone is terrible. Mt previous phone was an iPhone 5s which had much better reception. Something is wrong with phone. I\\'m on Verizon. In places where my 5s got consistently good reception this phone is lucky to get one dot. Same plastic case on both phones. Looks and work beautifully. Recommend to purchase from this vendor This phone is rly nice, i got a pink and a yellow 8xl for my parents. Set them both up and they were very fast and the screen way way better than i thought it wld be. They are running kk but i clda swore it was suppose to update to lp outa the box??? Either way it dont matter bc they are coming from an og atrix and a gnex :/ these phones are tremendous upgrades! $79 bucks on preorder cant be beat. there is some crutch on the front of the phone . but its work good and i will keep it It\\'s says dual Sim but black color is not.. Delivered on time and very durable haven\\'t had a problem Love this phone. Been using for a month now smooth run . This product is a scam. It is announced as \"US version\" but it is an international version. Great price and great phone Excelente The cell phone is \"Locked\".The description is wrong! I contacted Samsung, and they asked me to contact the service provider to get \"Network Control Key\" . I contacted T-Mobil. They said I don\\'t have an account with them, because I have AT&T sim card.I go back and forth so many times then found out that Samsung did not put out that description. The only one put out the description is the seller which is Amazon. I called Amazon to have this error corrected. I bought it and practically the same week they Change the price, a lower off course Beware. These are lemons - something is wrong with a lot of the phone these people sell. THEY ARE NOT NEW, no matter what it says. They are refurbs. I bought one from them, and wanted to return it since it had issues - they were willing to take it back. Only issue is I didn\\'t have a back up phone, so I got lazy and didn\\'t send it in time. PRO - great return policy, if the phone isn\\'t working right you can and SHOULD return it. Don\\'t get lazy like me.The phone had stripes across the screen within a few days. I ordered a new glass screen for the phone - another $80 blown. It works perfectly now. I mean I got a phone, just don\\'t think it was worth the money they charged. This phone does not work properly with AT&T service. I spent over an hour on the phone with ATT trying to get it to work right and it just doesn\\'t. Wont even send and receive texts dependably. Then after 2 weeks the screen cracked. The phone looks good, but its junk. Don\\'t waste your money. After some issues, not by the seller, the Item was as described. It\\'s perfect! And they gave me a car charger and two phones cases for the mishap. Thank you! I bought the Cell phone for my sister and She saids is perfect. You will not get a 1 yr Apple warranty with this purchase. My phone stopped working in 6 months with no damage to it. I contacted Apple and was told it was already replaced. I contacted the seller for refund and he just closed my request. Horrible experience. Will never buy from this seller. Nice phone,4g conection Really an excellent telephone .excellent prize Fully satisfied with this product. Even other people seem to like it. Brought it to AT&T for a SIM card and the Technician liked it was well. Hopefully some day they can make a removable battery so I can replace on-the-fly with no need for a charger. Battery life is sufficient for typical usage. Love love my phone! It\\'s a great phone love it will recommend buying it for yourself of a friend or a relative they will love it Great product, inexpensive price! Great size for gaming, streaming and Skype. Thanks. I really like the phone but two days after I got it, the Bluetooth feature would pair with the phone but the phone won\\'t allow me to make or receive calls using Bluetooth. Very unhappy with that! No problems and great durability for a flip phone with a front screen. Still have mine incase my smartphone breaks. The phone lasted a long time, my problem was more so with the inability to set alarms and when you set to-do items on your calendar and set an alarm to go off no sound went off to warn you. We are still getting used to our phones but I must admit they are more than I imagined. Works great with a few pain in the butt drawbacks. This phone really struggles with apps. It even buffers downloaded music. Great for the price but I would recommend another brand. Working excelent on Argentina carriers, the phone is a little heavy but it is worth it. Great phone. Though, its hard to get accessories for it (I know its not one of the newer phones out). No one here seems to carry HTC stuff (at a decent price anyway). It is different from my old Android phone!!! Some things are good changes, a few things I miss!! But I love it and am still learning new things!!! Hello I have the equipment with micro sim movistar vzla I say things in favor and things against, good: the team size is perfect super comfortable, the camera is very good compared to other computers high-end quality audio and video is excellent the team always fast and when you have no overloaded memory, have not had any failure so far, against only has 4GB very little memory, lock and volume buttons are on the back making it super uncomfortable for me, inicio buttons are built into the screen I think that takes away space, having space below the screen where is the LG logo ... Good phone for the price. i use it in europe and west africa. depending on the provider the net is slow in general.if you leave on the internet forget about this phone. Poor sound was nothing like i thought it would be!!!! Trash PHONE IS NOT INTERNATIONAL VERSION OR WORLD PHONE AND I HATE EVERY TIME I POWER UP OR GO TO CERTAIN FEATURES IT SAYS AT&T WHICH I CANT STAND I HAVE T-MOBILE SERVICE THEY JUST UNLOCKED AN AT&T PHONE. I love this phone..I need to get used to all the stuff on it..went from a flip phone to this. love the photos..thanks i love it,excellent phone Phone is OK. Only problem is home button malfunction. I have to press extra hard for it to work. Seller 100% recommended. He complied with everything. !!! Excellent, now i`m learning to use that. thanks The phone is NOT unlocked, locked with AT&T and will not work with any other service provider. Very disappointed. I was looking for an AT&T compatible phone. This is advertised as an unlocked GSM phone (which is compatible), but I received a Verizon phone, which is CDMA. It \"works\", but a lot of the functionality does not work, it has low bars of service, and is on an \" H\" network rather than 4G LTE. The phone I received even had the name Verizon written across it, which is not as advertised. everything was good with this purchase This is a good product considering its cost. Not to be used as a full smart phone due to its limited camera definition and functions, but a good temporary replacement or to be used by someone not looking for a highly technified or sophisticated device. Love it Nice one okay good This Phone is great!! excellente each used iPhone on Amazon will be different. Hard to tell which one you will get , in terms of batter life and wear and tear. Good luck! I purchase this item to sent to jamaica and phone was not unlock properly.Have to pay $4500 ja dollar to unlock phone properly. I specifically bought this version of the galaxy (rather than the newer s6) because it claimed to be waterproof. It wasn\\'t. Accidentally dropped it into some water (with all of the ports sealed and the back case on), and now it is dead. I tried to dry it out, but it is still dead. Of course the warranty doesn\\'t cover water damage... even though they market the phone as being protected against just this scenario. I was a loyal Samsung customer, but this is absolutely the last Samsung I will ever buy. I have also become THAT person who rails against Samsung at every opportunity. I will probably get some tee shirts made at the local airbrushing place at the mall with \"Samsung Lies\" printed across them, with a sad, dead, phone, slowly leaking water in the background. I will insist that all members of my family wear these shirts whenever they are in public. The kids will probably be happy with this arrangement, since they wanted iPhones anyway. Maybe I\\'ll hang a bedsheet with \"Don\\'t believe Samsung!\" hastily scrawled on it with dripping shoe polish from my balcony. I\\'ll lose all of my remaining friends (I have no idea how many friends I have left since my calls and texts have gone unanswered for days now), and have to resort to writing craigslist ads for new friends and a new phone, and then I\\'ll probably get murdered. All because I bought this stupid phone. Thanks, Samsung. Thanks for ruining my life.BTW, when it worked (for a month, before it\\'s \"waterproofing\" didn\\'t do it\\'s job) the phone was fine. Like the S4, but faster. And with fingerprints. And a heart rate monitor. The screen was pretty, with a warmer tone than the S4. I wasn\\'t a fan of the \\'recents\\' button instead of a menu button, but I probably would have gotten used to it if I had the chance. I\\'m not afraid to try new buttons. The sound would get a bit buzzy if you listened to headphones with the big charger plugged in, but that was okay too. everything fine. my wife loves this great smartphone, excelent service great item love this kind of phones Great price value relation i got an amazon gift card when i did my taxes...that was my first mistake. once i got the card, i had to spend it...i looked at phones and ordered a cheap iphone...but after i month i realised it was not coming...i have asked for my money back... Item received with wrong charger powerful smart phone perfect bought this phone a couple weeks ago, it has been fantastic,im not realy a smart phone geek but buying a 2nd one for my wife my carrier is t moble and l have great reception and good battery life An great product very recommendable Good good product Fantastic phone! Would be much better with expandable storage, but Google is beginning to take Apple\\'s philosophy on product design, so that is to be expected.The phone is snappy and charges fast, and the camera is absolutely top-notch. The fact that it works with all major carriers gives me the freedom to not feel tethered to my current company.Highly recommended! Nice phone. I just couldn\\'t get a reliable signal since it was an international version. Pointless to have a phone I can not use. Also theread we\\'re times when the phone would get hot when charging it. I used to charger that came with the phone. The finger print scanner is all that great either. I love the look and size of the phone, but having no service most of the time suck. Love it! Bought almost two years ago to use on Project FI, great phone and service Is not working and I coundn\\'t return on time. So I wasted my money. This was a bad desition. I regret about that. I really love this phone but arrived with an european travel adapter useless in America, I had to buy another charger, that\\'s why I do not give five stars. The product specs and description should mention about this adapter. Fire flame af 5 STARS BECAUSE THE SHIPPING WAS FAST AND I LOVE THE GOLD PLATINUM. ITS BRAND SPANKING NEW. I CRACKED THE SEALS MYSELF. IM FROM THE BAHAMAS AND THE INTERNATIONAL VERSION WORKS PERFECT WITH MY PREPAID CARRIER. IT IS 100% UNLOCKED. AND 100% WORKING. ID DEFIANTLY PURCHASE AGAIN.If you like this review or if you found it helpful, please click yes below. Thank you! bien Great buy! Good does not work great The phone I got a was In good condition as far as looks go and for the most part everything worked.The reason I didnt like the phone I got was because it liked to shut down when in use and mad it impossible to use. It\\' was like brand new Phone arrived broken and I was so embarrassed since I had bought this as a gift for a friend and imagine my horror when he pulled the plastic of f and opened the boxand the screen was shattered while the screen plastic was still on the phone and the battery was in the box. I bought this phone since it was factory unlocked so didn\\'t think that using any carrier Sim would be a problem. Save your money and time and yourself the embarrassment. Never buying phones from amazon ever... This phone is pretty cool. It comes with a case, charger, phone screen protector and headphones. I like this phone a lot for what it does. The only reason I did not rate it with 5 stars is because it is kind of slow but then again it gets all android apps and is probably the best phone I have purchased for the price. The only app I have had a problem with using is Google Maps which is huge. However, considering all the accessories come with including the screen protector and case I would give it 4 1/2 but that\\'s not an option on Amazon lol. It is compatible with my lifestyle as college student and mom. I would recommend buying if you are looking for a phone that is simple, cheap and effective. So far, so good! This is a really handy little device. I\\'ve used it in California, Utah and Mexico. I look forward to trying it in China.Great battery life. it is ok very good condition and the best every thing works I am talking about the software the internet it works whit all the conexion to wifi the playstore is very good I like it I think its defective or something and I cant upload pics as fast as my other phone and it doesn\\'t have google play store to get more games or widgets etc Hard to believe in 2016 this is my first smart phone (forced to upgrade by AT&T dropping 2G coverage the end of the year). I\\'m quite happy with it. The screen is large and easy to see except in direct sunlight. The camera is good quality. Haven\\'t done much yet with video. Texting is so much easier than the flip phone I was using. Still learning, but is intuitive. Not having much luck connecting to WiFi managed by older routers. Setting up router and phone profiles to match each other hasn\\'t worked. It took a bit of tinkering, but finally managed to get my home linksys router that is only about a year old to connect. Great phone. S little bigger than I thought. Great phone, battery lasts a lot (which is a real plus in my on call nights at the hospital), really reliable, im missing some things from my blackberry z10 but very minor like the integrated hub, the camera is very vivid, the screen size is perfect for reading books or articles.About the seller, excellent customer support, very straightforward dealing with issues and a great deal of patience. My sincere congratulations. Wanted to even buy more Excelent! It will not charge my iphonne 6 plus thats why I bought it!! Very good, but is not work one of the two sim. Once the phone was turned found out from Verizon it was defective. Could not see incoming calls only if left on voice mail never new who was calling excelente Vertical line on the screen. Too bad I had an iphone - hated it. Small screen, restrictive apps - too controlling!! A swype keyboard absent from the iphone and the small size were BIG pet peeves. Had an HTC Evo 4G prior to it and wanted to go back to the Android system, so I had an HTC Inspire which was very similar to the Evo and back to enjoying my cellphone app experience. After researching wanted to now try a Samsung Galaxy that was relatively inexpensive to try for 6 months or so and see if I want one of the current HTC\\'s or Samsung\\'s. When I received it everything was as expected and it is a great phone. The one con I have is that the micro-usb connector was defective, returned this and bought another from the same seller. (Not their fault - it was in new packaging.) Hence learned that micro-usb connectors can be somewhat of an issue with the pre-Samsung S5\\'s, but with many Youtube video\\'s on replacing a bad connector, I\\'m not worried about it as long as I get time with the phone before it needs replacing. Would have given 5-stars but the connector issue is a small concern. Almost all these phones from many makers pre-dating the past year had connector issues. I can even remember my HTC Evo getting loose and needing replacement under my warranty. So, while rating it a 4, I would have given it a 4.5. Love everything else about it, which is why I ordered a replacement. The power button didn\\'t even work and when I took the back off it was obvious that it was very very cheaply made I am so displeased. I wish I could get a refund. This is horrible. The phone is used and was not unlockedI have to unlocked the phone and cut my card.Best regards Phone cracked in my pocket within 3 days nooooo Works great to receive and open it seems of good quality wine in a box well protected. The number of stars not complete because I have not completely exceeds my expectations It\\'s hard to meet my expectations but this product did. Arrived fast and safe. So far so good. I was happy to find this. Thought you couldn\\'t buy just the clip. Increíble ‼️‼️‼️Gracias This phone is very slow. Also, it does not keep a very long charge. Additionally, it is very difficult to find a case that fits. I ordered several cases only to find out that the advertised product did not fit. Do not buy this phone. You will not be happy with it. This phone is awesome, and the price was excellent. My daughter is very pleased with this phone. just got itnothing i don\\'t like about it yetexcept i had to order a 2GB micro memory cardit messed up my 8gb and i had to reformat it Perfect I like this phone. It\\'s way batter than I thought And it works in Venezuela perfectly. Everything ok Works well and just as new This phone is great. The small annoyances of the 4S are gone with the 5. And buying refurbished is even better. A practically new phone for half the price? SOLD! When I first received my phone I was elated. A note tablet for less thann $200. Too good to be true. received my phone in April. It stopped working around August 25th. And now its September 10th and the phone wont even come on unless I plug it to the charger and keep it in. And even with that, the phone shows an all white screen. I cant see ANYTHING! When I unplug the charger Its a black and white screen sort of like an old TV without an Antenna and I can barely see what im doing. and then it cuts off.. SMH this is the worst company ever. Don\\'t waste your time or money. At first everything wll be good and you\\'ll feel like you\\'ve gotten the best deal ever... NOT... Bad company. CHeap product. If your looking for a phone that will last only 6 months or less then this it the one for you. other thAN THAT, stay away!!!!!!!!!!!!! Purchased this phone for my cousing overseas but it couldn\\'t be used, so I had to return it, can\\'t tell how it works... I just got the iPhone and it won\\'t cut on I was crushed when this phone stopped working. The screen stopped responding. There should be a way to fix it via the internet. I miss it, it was great. I still have it should there be a way, that someone could inform me Not long after purchasing this product it already is making me regret it. It randomly goes black and doesn\\'t allow me to restart it or turn it back on. After reading the reviews about some users experiencing glitches and malfunctions I should have went with my gut and not purchased this product. Don\\'t make the same mistake I did, you truly do get what you pay for. Everything Washington ok I was very very disappointed. This was the second HTC A9192 Inspire 4G. When my daughter received the first phone, she was so very excited because she was getting an early Christmas gift to take pictures and send them to her friends. She was not able to send nor receive pictures. We took the phone to T-MOBILE and they changed the settings but it still did not work so we returned it and purchased another. Amazon tried to make it right by sending it 2 days deliver so we would have it before Christmas but the delivery was delayed and I did not receive the phone till Christmas Eve. I returned from work on Christmas eve and learned that the new phone did not work. I took it to the AT&T store and they told me that the phone was damaged as it would not stay on, even after being charged overnight. Now, it will be a sad Christmas because not only could my daughter not take pictures but she does not have a phone. If you are buying this smarphone to using it in Argentina, be aware that the only version that works with 4G there is the ALE-L23. it was good Really nice phone more than expected for that price love it and that is all that I have to say about this product! Great phone. Wish u had informed me it was an AT&T phone Did not receive the charger that was suppose to come with phone. International version is not unlocked. I could not use the phone so I had to send it bad. Excellent product, it\\'s unlocked i\\'m using it in Venezuela. Great phone. Best Android I\\'ve had so far. A little laggy on things like Snapchat sometimes but definitely would recommend to someone who\\'s looking for a new phone and not wanting to spend a million dollars. Cannot receive all text on T-Mobile 4g...i have done everything from factory reset to latest update and still not able to receive text everything was ok. It was good when I first got it, ran really smoothly, nice size and price but soon began to deteriorate. And I mean SOON. I have had it only 6 months and am ready for a new phone. It\\'s starting to run very slow and apps are crashing left and right. It even rebooted on me once. The camera is trash unless you are in perfect lighting and the camera angle is much too narrow. Don\\'t buy it. I wish I had done better research on it. My daughter loves it!!! Didn\\'t have the galaxy s6 logo on the back though. This phone sucks..the ear piece is low...the battery is terrible... The key board is just said ...when u trying to enter a card number or even when texting it types n the wrong letter or number...I\\'m scared to purchase another ...do anyone have and idea brands to buy for straight talk services I had this phone for two months now the speakers out smh I bought this phone, and after about 7 weeks of working perfectly, suddenly overnight while placed on charge, instead of charging the battery, in the morning it was almost completely drained. It subsequently did drain totally and the phone died. I bought a new battery, and the same thing happened - as soon as I plugged it in to re-charge, it started discharging! Very strange. Anyway, this vendor would not accept the product back without all the manufacturer\\'s original packaging, and Amazon have refused to help, even though I\\'m a Prime member. So, KEEP YOUR ORIGINAL PACKAGING or you could end up with a phone that doesn\\'t work and no recourse. My next stop is Samsung - oh great, just what I need to fill my day with! Nice slim line phone, easily fits in pockets & purse pouches. Bought it and worked fine at first now 2 months later phone freezes and cuts off randomly It is good. charger is samsung charger Great phone. I love it. Despite the negatives below.Some things:- I cracked the screen and apparently even the smallest crack on screen makes the touch unresponsive rendering the phone useless. I got it replaced and it works fine now. I think to fix just the screen is more expensive than other flagship phones like Samsung. It cost me $230 in the states to fix. In order to fix they have to remove everything from the phone to get toit.- The battery is hard to remove. You have to heat the back and pry it open to get to the battery.- I haven\\'t dunked my phone completely in the water or anything. But I\\'m not exactly careful when it comes to water and it works fine. Examples include me using phone when bathing with wet hands, rain, spills and putting phone under a running faucet to clean it lol.- There is complaints of the phone getting very hot and overheating. Honestly its not that bad, any phone can get hot after prolonged use and I have never had it overheat to the point where it shuts down . I think that when I first got the phone it would get hotter quickly opposed to how it is now. My theory is that it was a new unused phone and was not used to being used as much as it is now.- if I think of anything else I\\'ll come back Good The phone look snice but it real slow and keeps freezing up my phone continuously shuts down by itself exellent I love my new wrist watch but it\\'s not water proof. It does everything the seller said it would. This phone is turning out to be my favorite cellphone. The only flaw is in order to get the back up button to go onto the screen, you must swipe upwards at the very bottom of the screen a few times to register it on the screen but other than that its perfect in many ways. For one its unlocked! Bonus! 2. It has an easy to use highly effective system with fast internet. 3. The screen is 6\" which is perfect for viewing videos. 4. It isn\\'t super clogged up with apps that I hate. Another bonus! Great phone! Came faster then expected, thanks cellathon. I\\'ve used androids and iPhones, so this is the first time I used a Windows phone. So as I\\'ll be using this as my work phone, I\\'ll be learning and getting use to the phone. it;s good. Great size. About the same as the Samsung Galaxy S5, but without (so far) the display problem drama. Great pure Android unlocked phone. AT&T network works fine and so does Verizon. (I have not used it with any other carriers). Note that if you are moving from a locked feature phone to a smart phone like the 5X, you will probably have to transfer your phone book by purchasing a SIM reader and then upload the address book .vcf file to Google Cloud, as I had to. Like the Kindle Fire\\'s link to Amazon. , this phone is solidly linked to Google and works best in the Google sphere.I recommend buying this phone directly from Google as they offer an extended warranty that is not available through Amazon or other second party dealers.Why four stars? One feature we would like, the IR \"blaster\" is not included, meaning it can\\'t be used as a multimedia remote control. We also found that the alarm app supplied by Google hung after notification with no way to turn it off except by rebooting. And there appears to be little if any water resistance. No IP-65 or IP-67 rating. Battery life till recharge notification is 1-1/4 to two days with minimal calling. Very good phone. I am from the Caribbean, and I had no problems with it. Would highly recommend. I received my phone yesterday and it worked perfectly. I had a slight problem but the seller was fast to solve it!! Good product This phone is an excellent phone. However, it\\'s only for Sprint customers . The phone bill is $100.00 a month and it does NOT come with a sim card. Great little phone I bought this phone for someone else. This is a good value phone with many features at a much lower price than offers from Samsung and Apple. On the other hand there is one issue that I noticed when speaking with someone who is using this phone. The microphone. If you ever heard of someone talking directly in to a microphone by being too close to it and producing a muffling sound, this is what this phone sounds like when I call it. I\\'m not sure if this is some kind of defect or not but having the person switch to a different phone made the problem go away. This is a problem since I can\\'t understand what is being said. Supposedly no one else has complained about this so far. Excellent phone, very pleased. No issues at all so far Pretty good for a cheap phone! Please note, this is my one day review. The only slight issues I had were: 1. getting the microSD seated properly. I had to remove it a couple of time to get the phone to read it. 2. Small internal memory. You can switch some apps to your memory card, but not all. Consequently, you will need to stick to apps you actually use. If you are an App hog, this phone isn\\'t for you.Phone, messaging, battery life, dual-sim, data all work as advertised. It is a slightly old-style capacitive screen, but it really isn\\'t bad... especially for an adult with big fingers.Best of all, it is Android 5.1.I needed an inexpensive unlocked phone and this worked-out well ... excellent phone.. easy, quickly and light I had it for 2 weeks And now its broken can i request another one out of my warranty I love windows phones. I\\'ve had android and I couldn\\'t wait until they started making windows again. I bought one with a lot of memory since the memory chips in the android phones do not work as advertised. This one has 32 gb and so far holds all the pictures, music, and audible books I want and I am no where near the memory limit.WHAT I DON\"T LIKE:Mine came speaking French and did not have a qwerty keyboard. Fortunately, I knew enough French to fiddle with it, then gave up and let my 13 year old figure out how to turn it to English. Then I finally discovered that if you remove Chinese as the keyboard/language option, it goes back to qwerty keyboardIt has a good memory, but you can\\'t add a sd or micro sd card to it.The maps I downloaded work 20% of the time, and never when I\\'m lost and need them, usually only on my street when I\\'m pretty sure I know how to get home.I have trouble downloading any pictures that are sent from android/Iphones. I usually text them and say - can\\'t see it - it\\'s annoying. Probably just a setting, but I\\'ve had it over a month and I still can\\'t receive pics.I have yet to figure out how to get it to work on data v wifi. Better consult a 12 year old huh?WHAT I LIKE:The memory - it rocks!I have security cameras from blu iris that I monitor from my cell phone - this has enough memory to see my cameras when the Wi-Fi work.I love LOVE LOVE the way it interacts with Audible - I love listening to audio books and this app for windows on this phone works seamlessly so I can pop between stories with ease.I love that is ok with syncing my 5 or so email accounts for business work, kids, etc so that I can see all of them separated as they should be on my phone.I love windows. It\\'s how tech should be. MY son was very satisfied it is ok very good condition and the best every thing works I am talking about the software the internet it works whit all the conexion to wifi the playstore is very good I like it Excellent best customer service you definitely earned 5 stars phone in perfect condition works really fine thank you !!! Horrible, the phone arrived on time and I went to a T-Mobile store to have it set up as soon as I got it! After my card was put in, I couldn\\'t get anything to work. It was locked, maybe it only works for Verizon phones...whatever. My punishment for buying a cheap phone online, it has cheap use. The back of the phone doesn\\'t even fit on properly, it\\'ll go 2/3 of the way in and then there\\'s a section of the back cover sticking out. It\\'s not even the same model! I got the same model at the T-Mobile store for a cheaper price, only two weeks of use, and the best part? it actually works. It is very comprehesive, Highly recommend i can\\'t unlock this phone..... I had emailed the seller If there is anyway I could get a faster ship date, and they said absolutely! And would get on it first thing the next day. So I received the phone within a week! In excellent condition! All original packaging and all that good stuff. I really appreciated how nice they were to me! The phone looks to be in great condition, however it\\'s not for me, it\\'s for my teenage sister so it\\'s not yet active. Therefore I do not know how it functions, if it glitches, if the buttons don\\'t work, ect.... I hope nothing is wrong with the phone considering the amount of money I paid for it. And as buyers we shouldn\\'t have to worry about buying electronics that DON\\'T work. There are some scratches on the front screen but other than that, that is all I can see wrong. And even then, it\\'s for my sister so she\\'s pretty great full she\\'s even getting a phone. Pure junk. Something for kids. Whack programming. Cheesy This is tiny! A lot of people think it is a toy, but I\\'ve been using it for about 2 months now and it works great. I just wanted something to talk and text, I use my tablet for the web searches and facebook, so I just wanted something that fit in my small purse nicely. I downloaded a swype app so I could text better because it is really difficult to text without it. I also get random texts every two weeks or so from GoDaddy and one other online place. I assume they got my info from this phone purchase because I never got them before. (hence the 4 star rating) It\\'s definitely a conversation piece. It uses real Android technology, so my google calendar is on here (the only other thing I was hoping I wouldn\\'t lose when I went smaller) My husband loves his new phone! . Fast service! good Pefecto Nice phone, pretty, work good, have everything that kids need. Good and not expensive for a smart phone.Essay to use I recently answered a question on whether the phone I bought was a clone or prefab. It is not a Nokia Android clone of the Windows8 OS. If it is a prefab, I don\\'t know. As I stated in the response, I thought Nokia manufactured their phones in Sweden not in Hong Kong. Probably assembled in China and distributed to the International market out of Hong Kong. The phone was preconfigured for the Hong Kong Market. Though it was in Hong Kong English, it was easy enough to reset the phone without losing the app bundle it came with. Apps were enough for video+music, camera, a driving navigator, a walking map, public transit, some Nokia proprietary apps that work well; like the panoramic camera app that stiches together about 4 pictures. The Mobile office suite excel, power point and word, with office 365 to sync with your other MS Office software. I had to install a third party file manager app to access files on my SD card. 8 gigs onboard mem is ok. Though if you want to save maps directly to the onboard mem, memory be eaten up fast. I loaded about 7 apps and have 2.68 gigs left. I mentioned that maps, because even though I asked the maps to load to the SD card, they did not. I was happy they didn\\'t, because transferring the SD card from my phone to my tablet, corrupted the data. I doubt it was an issue with the phone. However, I was overseas and needed the maps, and was thankful that they were on the phone\\'s memory. The phone arrived about a week before the \"no later than date\" which was about 3 weeks. I am rating this particular purchase at three stars for 3 reasons. First, the phone has a black back case and not red, as requested. Sounds trivial, but I wonder what else was not \"as advertised\"? For example, at the vendor you will get the latest OS with the latest bundle. I got Windows 8.0, where at the vendor, the phone was loaded with Windows 8.1. Maybe not a big deal until I actually ask to upgrade the OS. Second, the phone runs hot when browsing the internet and also using GPS actively (GPS when in flight mode). So I wonder about the CPU. It is a 1.7 dual core, but so is my tablet that doesn\\'t run hot (significantly hot). I wonder if the phone is a prefab or if the chip is overclocked (inferior chip running faster than advised) to save on money. Third, the initial price was attractive at about $277, but after paying $23 to ship to an FPO AE, the savings of purchasing online didn\\'t really outweigh the peace of mind of purchasing the same phone at a local vendor, where I can walk over and have it serviced or returned immediately if necessary. I would have paid $70 more at the local vendor. The battery life is decent lasting a whole day with some web browsing, watching around 1.5hrs of video, using the GPS and a few short phone calls. When I did notice the phone getting hot, it did consume more battery life that usual. I was slightly worried that the G4 standard here in Italy would not be compatible with the frequency published, but it works great. Sometimes a webpage will hang, other times pages will pop right up. The webpages hanging are starting to get annoying. The Windows8 interface for me is a breath of fresh air compared the Android OSs that I use on my Samsung tablets. I find the interface to be simpler and quicker for that matter.

MY OLD CELLPHONE WAS BROKEN, SO I DID NOT RETURN IT. The phone feels solid and fast. Screen is beautiful. Does not seem to have the touch screen stutter problem like the other BLU phone I had. I bought this phone for it\\'s large battery, and it can last 2 days easily. With careful programming of when to turn wifi on, it can last even longer. Very happy with it. Very good Great phone no issues for me ALMOST A Perfect phone for me I bought this for my son. His previous phone did not have sufficient storage. On this phone he was able to download all his favorite apps. I love the forward facing flash on this phone. I wish my phone had one. It is almost the same size as my note 4. He loved it. Phone was as in better condition than described. 100% happy with this purchase and I would buy from this seller again. Best phone I\\'ve ever had. I am not brave enough to test if it is waterproof. very nice phone. this phone works good. every performance are perfact. I\\'ve owned a lot of phones over the years. This has to be, by far, the worst. Both my husband and I purchased this phone a few months ago. Both of them are junk. My phones vibrates twice a day forcing a reboot to resolve. My husband\\'s vibrates twice a week. Both phones brightness just magically get turned down on the lowest settings in the middle of using them forcing you to go into settings and adjust. Some keys on phone require you to tap three or four times to get a response... If you want a paperweight or a vibrator - LOL, then this phone is for you. as good as advertised......replaced same model, old one had liquid spilled on it and did not recover.....very satisfied with it..... the phone came damaged always turn off .. i need to change it .. can i do it something ? the problem was since first week of us I love it. its ok Good phone :) Great! I have only had it for a few days, but works and looks like new so far! my daughter loves it Ended up not being able to use it on my plan, but very fast shipping and very nice phone. So this phone worked fine in the US. But I got it because it has international capabilities, however, when my mother took it to Tanzania, it crashed,.. Now I have to buy a new phone(-: the phone does not work.the screen goes blank the phone damaged in factory Love the phone! Exellent I bought it for someone as a gift for use overseas. She said that the phone works very well and seems to be satisfied. The phone is very user friendly and small enough to fit a woman purse. I consider it a good purchase. Thanks excelent I love this phone. It is feature packed. Dislikes only that there is a bot of bloatware, but you can disable it. The battery does not last long if you leave everything running though, so be sure to take advantage of disabling the bloatware. wow what a cell phone. amazed at what it can do. kit kat installed with no problem, sound and picture quality is amazing.fits nice in my hand. i was used to the note 2. but i am loving this one. a great price for a very smart phone. GO GOOGLE NOW Ordered phone but it would not work with AT&T. Called company and told it was due to lack of towers. Found that odd since my cell is at&t It is good. I am happy. Excellent Thanks. Good excellent seller, recommend After using for only 1 month, the plastic hinge already broke. Very disappointed. The kids love their iPhone. Had this for a few months now and can\\'t be happier with it. A great phone. Excellent phone!!! This phone uses an old version of Android. It is _NOT_ compatible with the GoogleVoice application. I wanted to be able to view voice mail on this screen - not just know I had a VoiceMail message. Unfortunately, can\\'t do it. Tech support claims they are working on it, but lots of posts on their support forum indicate that this is a long-standing issue. I\\'d recommend waiting for a phone that supports the newer Android OS before trying this again. I went back to the older Grandstream (non-android) which works perfectly. Best basic phone I\\'ve owned. Even has touchscreen part to write your text out my hand, pretty neat. Fast, no freezing, no dropped calls. I did not realize that only had 500 MB of RAM Nice !! I love this phone! It can do everything you need it to, and it is fast. The other reveiws are just people who didnt take care of their items. I would buy again :D I love the phone. It\\'s exactly as described and it is working very very good. I got it 5 days ago and I haven\\'t have any problem with it. I\\'ll let you know if I have any in the next weeks. When I saw this product I was excited to see because I do not have to pickup phone while driving car can talk like James bond, easy alternate method for phone. I do not like the band and clock background of product. Band is too hard not easy to put battery and had struggle. Clock background does not look professional; I do not know how to change it at this moment. Overall product delivery is ok and not good or excellent. ONE STAR i love this phone. my first iphone and its new, brand new. It was terrible. Ordered the phone for my brother and it was working for about a month. All of a sudden the damn thing went blank. Money down the drain. I DEMAND A REFUND!! Not even worth 1 star Nice but lags After 6 months the phone has stopped working Really unblocked phone. Has Russian in settings. Excellent phone. I knew the s4 was the phone I wanted. I needed GSM quad-band factory unlocked for use with international pre-paid SIMs (specifically European and Asian in the near future). This is the right phone. This one was for my wife and I bought another one on Amazon for myself. The one I bought for myself was technically international, it does accept SIMs from South America, all over North America, and the Caribbean. However, that other one does not accept Asian or European SIMs. Be careful what you buy on Amazon I guess is the lesson learned. Other reviews on this phone seem to state they did not get what they expected from this vendor (T-Mobile unlocked rather than truly factory unlocked, etc.). I did get exactly what I needed from this vendor, however another failed me. So, again, buyer beware. Also, don\\'t open your phone\\'s box in the dark because you are so excited it has arrived :-) I did that with the Americas phone and am now stuck with it.However, just to reiterate, this phone is exactly what I wanted and fit the bill perfectly. My experience with this particular phone is completely perfect. Purchased for a friend. She\\'s enjoying her new phone although I had an okay/bad experience with blu nonetheless, she likes it. Its not a good cell phone!!!! First, a little background, for perspective: I\\'m an ex-iphone user, migrated from iphone to Android a few years ago, for the freedom and open-ness of the OS. I\\'ve really liked the Android OS and the phones I\\'ve bought along the way. A few months ago I bought a Lumia 521 with a new Metro PCS account. The Lumia 521 introduced me to Windows 8 Phone OS and I was amazed at how fluid, intuitive and FUN it is - so I decided to fork out for a premium Windows Phone ... which is what brought me to the Lumia 820.The NOKIA LUMIA 820 is SOLID. It\\'s heavy in the hand and has a stable, durable feel to it. The display is vibrant and beautiful. Reviewers and \"experts\" out there on the web can say anything they want about resolution, rag on the pixel density, whatever - but this phone, in your hand is BEAUTIFUL. Colors pop, photos are crisp and videos look great!As was the case with my (brief) experience on the Lumia 521, this is quick, nimble, FAST. Every operation is there when called for, tasks present themselves immediately and close just as quickly. There\\'s something about this Windows OS that must be much less resource-intensive, less hungry than other mobile OS\\'s, because things just pop and fly all over the place.The Tiles ... live tiles, that represent what feels like a living, breathing OS Interface. You see the faces of your contacts and friends rotating in and out of the \"People\" tile ... Facebook posts of friends \"pop up\" in live time, as they are happening ... News updates circulate in a tile, the tile suddenly flips over to reveal another breaking headline ... the tile from your Songza app suddenly flips over to say \"It is Friday Night\" (or late Saturday morning, etc.) ... the Photos tile rotates through your albums, scrolling slowly and continuously ... nothing stands still, this tiled-interface is alive!More on Tiles ... you can size and re-size your tiles, according to taste; regular (square), large (rectangle that covers width of the screen) or small (one quarter size of regular). You can even Pin your favorite websites to the screen, each in a tile of it\\'s own. I\\'ve got four favorite Playlists (from Nokia Music) pinned to my screen, each re-sized to small, and they form a little music \"block\", the size of a regular tile!The Lumia 820 has NFC capability and Wireless Charging - something I didn\\'t think I\\'d ever need or use, but I did fork out for the charging plate and it\\'s been a very nice bonus. I\\'ve already grown lazy, with the ability to simply place the phone on it\\'s back for a charge ... no plugs, cables or hassles.CUSTOMIZATION! Unlike other phones in the Lumia lineup, this one has interchangeable back plates. Once in place, it looks like a solid piece of polycarbonate. You can make this a Cyan phone, a bright Red phone, Yellow, White or Black, simply by putting a different (removable) back plate on it. You can order these with or without NFC and Wireless Charging capability. This phone was black when I bought it, I\\'ve since changed it to Cyan (and have other colors on order).Is the 920 a better phone? How about the 928? Well, the specs are better on those phones, but for me, this is the sweet spot. It\\'s smaller than the 920, but with the same screen size, and (again), with the joy of body / color customization. Processing speed? System RAM? What are those??? What do I care? When a phone is as fast, fluid, stable and zippy as this is, who cares? When you get a phone that performs as beautifully as this, you can forget about specs (and forget the \"expert\" opinions from the tech sites). None of it matters.Apps ... yes, you hear a lot of whining, complaining, hand-wringing criticism of the Windows app store and it\\'s \"horrible dearth of apps\". If you believe what you read out there on the internet, you probably figure they\\'ve got about 10 or 20 apps in the store. I don\\'t know WHO these people are, or WHAT they have on their own phones, but inasmuch as the Windows store has over a hundred thousand apps (126,000 as of last night) ... I feel that is enough for me (and for any reasonable person). Sure, you can bolster your app store to a million, 50 million, a billion, whatever - but when 50,000 of those apps are flashlights (as opposed to one flashlight), how is that improving your app experience?The 8GB of internal space ... once the OS requirements are subtracted, you\\'ve got about 5 or 6 gigs to yourself. Unlike it\\'s bigger brethren in the Lumia family, this one comes with a Micro SD slot. I\\'ve got a 32GB card in mine, and have set the phone to load all photos, music and videos to the card (rather than to internal storage). That should hold me for awhile.The Camera ... with Carl Zeiss optics and Dual LED Flash, the 8.7 megapixel camera and quality of your photos will be excellent. I\\'ve also loaded an HDR app from the store and have experimented with it, garnering some very nice results. I\\'ve been taking photos for Instagram, Foodspotting, Facebook and Twitter so far, nothing that requires a critical eye or instrument. I have also set my phone to auto-upload all photos and videos to Skydrive, so I\\'ve got an instant backup of everything I\\'ve taken.I\\'m not going to spend any time hashing-out or \"reviewing\" technical details, you\\'ll get plenty of that in other reviews (and websites). Suffice it to say, this is one of the best and THE most enjoyable phone I\\'ve ever owned. no problems. The phone itself is just great, but when I got the package the phone box was not sealed and it turned out that the charger was for UK, so the store added a big adapter, and the worse was that the headphones inside the box didn\\'t correspond with the ones that are showed in the publicity. Good product, good for Sony, but bad store to buy. My personal advise: If you- don\\'t like the bulky feeling of today\\'s smartphones in your pocket and wish for something extremely light and easy to carry around- are fed up with constantly checking, reading, writing \\'stuff\\' on your smartphone- would like to bar your phone interfering with your interactions with your surrounding- don\\'t mind not having a 5MP camera- or want to carry a tiny Bond-style phone for security reasonsthen it\\'s a great buy.I used to have a 4\\'\\' LG and having replaced it with this one more than a month ago, I can tell you now that I feel much \\'lighter\\' and happier. Not because the phone is the best in the market but because I\\'m one of the above type of customers. Since I bought it, I am much more engaged with my surrounding and have my hands & eyes free.PROS: Not just small but extremely lightweight and cute to carry around. The chances of losing/forgetting it somewhere is extremely low because you won\\'t take it out of your pocked unless you have a notification or a call. Similarly, the chances of someone stealing it is rather low, in my opinion, \\'cause at first sight, nobody thinks that this is an actual smartphone with all features! I guess it\\'s also fair to say that the phone decreases your chances of being run over by car significantly because you\\'ll watch the traffic more carefully. It has all the benefits of an android phone. Spotify, Soundcloud, FB messenger, Maps, front and read cameras etc. it has everything you\\'d need. I\\'ve never experienced memory shortage - Gdrive, Spotify, Soundcloud, PodcastRep, Calendar etc. are all installed without any memory problem. Since you don\\'t use it much, the battery is also pretty sufficient. But I think the best feature is that IT HAS A RECORD FEATURE FOR FM RADIO!CONS: The touchscreen is slow, sometimes you\\'ve to touch things twice. The touchscreen is too small, sometimes you have to touch the screen couple of times until you hit the right thing (My advice is to go for Google voice keyboard or Swipe keyboard. It works pretty well and swiftly). I don\\'t know whether this is a general problem but mine sometimes doesn\\'t show the battery correctly. I mean, for almost an entire day it said the battery is %61 and I was already wondering what\\'s going on.. Yeah, the next morning I found it laying dead on the floor. But as I said, the battery life is pretty sufficient. Mine just doesn\\'t show it correctly sometimes and this might lead to miscalculations (just saying). This is a very good entry level, mid range device. It is not going to blow your mind away, but it is good enough to get you through the day. I like the design and some of the special functionality like the floating touch and the fact that you can use it with gloves on. The camera is very good to be a 5MP sensor. The only con that I find with it is that it doesn\\'t have a front facing camera. Very speedy no excessive amounts of stuttering, lag. Very good product from Sony. Very good so far This is a great phone. Built-in WIFI, GPS, pdf reader, word, excel and powerpoint editing apps among others. You can also download tons of apps. The phone is relatively small for the features it offers and very very thin. Although the keys are compacted/close you will have no problems typing. Great phone. Has some rays on the display but they\\'re very small 8-10. Great Seller, I recommend I love this phone. I had been looking for an inexpensive android phone and this is it. It does everything I want it to do and more. Great phone, many interesting features. Beautiful resolution. Works well. Only \"gripe,\" and it isn\\'t such a huge one, if I take sim card out for any reason, contacts are gone when I reinsert sim in phone. Contacts remain on sim, but don\\'t show back up on phone. Probably an operator problem, but I found that a bit annoying. It has great reception and sound. Otherwise, it is a great phone and I would recommend it to anyone looking for \"Blackberry\" equivalent. I actually have a Blackberry Curve (older version) and I like the Nokia much better. Excellent Good Works aspected. Great good good Probably is a really nice phone but despite watching 2 U Tube videos on how to remove the back of the phone so the battery and SIM card can be inserted, I could not get the back off. Broken thumb nails down to the quick of the nails on both hands to show for my efforts. Followed all directions to the letter and the back just will not release so I have requested a return from the seller and am waiting for an RMA. I purchased this phone on July 24th and the battery died within 3 months. I am not satisfied with a phone that stops working within 3 months. Also do not use Wireless Place to buy this product. They told me it was not their fault for selling a defective product.To be clear, I replaced the battery and the phone still won\\'t work. It\\'s not even the battery, its the defective phone. I can\\'t download whatsapp and messenger on my BlackBerry 9780 good package .. Nice phone ... as per my expectations .. thanks It\\'s a low grade phone , I returned it the same day I love it. This phone is great. It was fast shipping and accurrate discription.. I love it Phone is perfect size for me, and is intuitive to use. Can\\'t beat the price for all the features and 32GB!! It is close to the Galaxy 5 without the cost. Processor is quick. Camera works well. Battery charge could last longer, then I would give it 5 stars. It\\'s a great iPhone at a great price. Love it! Nice phone but battery life is only 2 - 3 hrs on my new phone The phone finally arrived (2nd attempt) but it was worth the wait. Beautiful phone. I have no problems with it so far. Not a feature rich phone but a good value. Love it Fast delivery ,good product . Thanks. When plugged into charger touch screen doesn\\'t work right most of the time. Other than that its a great value for a great phone. Got this for my 12 year old and its an he loves it because of the slider and easy to use keypad I love my new phone. And it arrived fairly quickly. I am very happy. The phone has a very good camera, beautiful display and responds well to touch. It hangs at times but i guess most other phones do that I purchased this as a gift for my husband and he just loves it. A bit annoying to have to manually delete receiving calls or messages from watch even if you deleted it from, but otherwise a really great product. Product is as described with the exception of the UK and European adapters, which were not included. I noticed others made the same comment so the pictures should be updated to reflect the actual contents. Otherwise product is new and performs as advertised. I have installed an International SIM card (which is suprisingly expensive for the people calling and texting me) and will be using the phome in Germany and the Middle East later this month. Excelente I can\\'t buy a micro sim card for it anywhere This is my first smart phone, so I think it is a good one to start with. Only one problem I have run into, but not big enough for me to return it. On occasion, when using the dial pad, it will go blank and I have to keep pressing it back on. I mainly use the phone for locating places and for apps like my bank, restaurant locator, cheap gas locator... that type of stuff. Also, I text more than I talk on my phone and that has been working well. At first the cell worked perfectly but now the touch screeen sucks Very limited compatibility. Even took it to the \"Geek Squad\" (which was more than I should have to do) and they could not sync it. Do not recommend. Ok phone, pretty slow though. Crashes fairly often, especially when trying to text or check email. Ok for the price. good Everything ok Best phone i have had in a long time. Love the speed in searching mode. :) just... perfect. Easy to put on your phone. Protects your phone. I have dropped it a couple times and no anxiety about it being broke. Would recommend to my friends. Can\\'t customize to Israel.can\\'t find network ,call and recedive calls frequntlywithout knowing.went to a lab, didnt help.zooming probloem during video.i bought 2.both have the same problem.1 has probloms with finding network and keeping network, finding and keeping wifi, camera zoom during video. One week after used it the phone start acting up, the screen frozen and intermittently lost signal.Not only that, the phone easily to get hot, I see many people has the same issues. I guess the phone it self has hardware problem. I return it back very good This phone survived a 50 minute laundry wash cycle today because it was hiding in a pair of jeans. Very impressed. This is a very good phone. The price is very reasonable and it functions just as good as those posh, ridiculously expensive phones. I had to return it. I have T-Mobile and it kept disconnecting from the network. I am really bummed because it is such a great phone. Works fine! I was super pleased with the phone and I will definitely be getting more. Really like the phone. Came without a charger. Was told they would send it. They never did. I have it for a about a year and works great! Great phone. No issues. If you\\'re in the United States, LTE bands will not be compatible but gsm and hspa are compatible. I\\'m happy with the purchase. Excelent excellent Very nice windows phone, great price. Bought it to replace a Blackberry that wore out in slightly over a year and did not want toextend my ATT contract. My only concern is that the back is somewhat flimsy and might come off after extended use. Phone was ok. Returned because screen cracked while in my pocket with no other objects. Sound on alarm was too soft to wake you. I\\'m very happy with the purchase! The phone works perfectly, and as I expected. My one small complain is that the top part of the screen kinda edge out of its case, so I occasionally have to push it back in so it\\'s snug. It doesn\\'t come out but starts to edge out, which I\\'m guessing is because the screen was once replaced. I\\'ve replaced a screen in the past and the same thing would happen because some of the glue and snuggness of everything is lost when parts are changed. In any case, its not enough to bother me and I\\'ve got a good case for it, so I\\'m looking forward to lots of time with this phone. For the price it\\'s excellent. I really love this phone. Just as seller say it would be The phone works fine but it\\'s not possible to set it in Spanish, it only can be set in English or Asian languages. If there was an option to do less than one star I would. First off it was a day late when I paid extra for speedy delivery. That didn\\'t bother me until I realized I got screwed all togethr. This phone is not as advertized at all. I wasn\\'t even able to activate it through my carrier. Looks nice on the outside but once you turn it on, even the screen seems off. I suggest Amazon remove this advertizment all together. If you\\'re lucky and you get this phone, it\\'s great. But BEWARE of fraudulent sellers (e.g. S***TY_Services_WORST_Practices)Let\\'s face it. Someone buying am \"UNLOCKED International Version No Warranty \" phone, is doing it for only one reason: To use it outside the US.So a crook seller sees an oportunity to commit fraud: Let\\'s sell them some $50 used cel phone with a sticker that says i9195 for $300 and when they noticed they where ripped off, they\\'ll be out of the country and won\\'t be able to complain.That was almost my story. Luckily I was able to notice ON TIME, that the model number behind the battery was for an used S7562 (a $50 cel) and not a new i9195 (a $300 one). The worst was that this is a fraud and not an error, since the sticker outside said i9195. They know what they where doing, and they do it on purpose, to criminally cheat us. I tried to contact the seller, but they didn\\'t want to solve the problem, they even insulted me. Luckly, I contacted Amazon and they refunded me the money and I bought it again in another seller, and got the i9195 I wanted (which is great). But I was almost ripped of by this \"Quality_Services_Best_Practices\" crooks. Do you want to risk buying from crooks like these?Read the other reviews for this phone. And you\\'ll se some happy people and some angry ones. This is not due to the phone itself. Some sellers are S***TY_Services_WORST_Practices and they commit fraud to people, hoping they can\\'t complaing from abroad.The i9195 is a GREAT phone, just google i9195 review and you\\'ll see. But you are reading this review, because you pay for the phone YOU GET, and at first I didn\\' get what I ordered.Be extremely aware from what seller you buy this \"international\" phone, because some are just waiting to rip you off Great Purchased to use on Cricket Wireless (AT&T towers). Arrived as promised via Amazon. First impressions are all positive. Price was great and phone seems to be very well built. This version has an 8 megapixel rear camera and comes with 8 gigabytes of internal storage. Wireless and Bluetooth work as they should, and 4G network activity is as expected. The only minor concern that I have is the screen. Yes, they do provide a screen protector, but it\\'s difficult to apply properly. I wonder why they don\\'t use Gorilla Glass or something similar. Even if it increased the cost by a few dollars, it would be well worth it. I am biased: I love BlackBerry phones. I owned the Bold and the Curve back in the early days of smartphones, then I got all caught up in the iPhone craze. I came back to BlackBerry when, to my surprise, I discovered they were still in business and making great phones. I ditched the iPhone, got a Q10 and then a Passport. I love, love, love BB10, the current OS. But, like a lot of people, I really missed some of the apps I used on the iPhone. Of course, BB10 can run some Android apps, just not all of them and some of them run poorly. Then I found the Priv. It\\'s an odd but swanky phone that people notice and you\\'ll enjoy using in public.First, let me say that it\\'s a near-top-of-the-line Android phone, so if you like Android, you\\'ll love the Priv. BlackBerry has tweaked the OS slightly and that tweaking seems to have improved the over all security of the phone. It comes with the Google Play store preloaded and that is the ONLY place to get your apps, unless you want to download APKPure, another great source for Android apps. Your BlackBerry apps are not available for the Priv. This is a BlackBerry phone in name only.Second, this thing is fast! I mean blazing fast. I used the Galaxy Note (not sure which version) to compare, and the Priv compares favorably, though the screen was slightly smaller. Speaking of the screen, it\\'s a huge selling point. Streaming videos (Netflix or ones locally stored) look awesome.Third, the rear facing camera is slightly better than average. The front facing camera is not the greatest. So if you are a compulsive, narcissistic selfie addict, you\\'ll be underwhelmed. The onboard photography suit is pretty decent, though.Fourth, the keyboards. Yes, plural. The slide-out physical keyboard is good, although the keys seem small to me. Mind you, I was used to the awesome Passport with it\\'s large keys, so my judgment might be a bit subjective. Typing using the physical keyboard was a bit of a chore, and eventually I found myself slapping it shut so I could use the virtual keyboard, which is outstanding, I have to say. BlackBerry has scored with its virtual keyboard; it\\'s far, far superior to the iPhone keyboard.Lastly, I give this phone 5 stars because it is a good piece of technology. People get all caught up in buying a \"name,\" like Samsung or iPhone, but the BlackBerry Priv holds its own in a world awash with good quality phones. One final point, the build quality is unsurpassed. This thing is tough; a lot tougher than it feels, which is to me, its only downside - how it feels in the hand. Maybe it\\'s the slider mechanism, but this phone doesn\\'t feel as \"solid\" as the Passport or the Q10. But it is, I assure you. I\\'ve dropped it a couple of times and you\\'d never know it.In the end, I still prefer the BB10 OS to the Android OS; it\\'s smoother, prettier, and more intuitive. My Passport remains by favorite, go-to phone. But there\\'s no denying that the Priv is a top notch smartphone that is hard to beat and fun to use. It was way overpriced when it first came out, but the price has really come down in recent months, making the Priv a wise choice. Thought this was a 5S OtterBox case but it ended up being just a 5 so now I can\\'t use the thumbprint sensor on the phone but it is OtterBox so can\\'t complain. Comes with tons of Sony bloatware. Doesn\\'t hold up. Gets very hot. No support from Sony if you\\'re in the US market and need a repair. Screen cracked after fall from 3 feet onto concrete floor. Had protective case and tempered glass screen protector, but still cracked on impact. Now it\\'s an expensive paperweight. Excelente The build quality of the phone is great.. However, the phone performance is very slow /laggy when doing \"normal\" tasks (opening, closing apps, browsing through the phone)I\\'m also not impressed with the battery life of the phone. very much I just received this phone - from Mega Mobiles - and it arrived brand-new in a sealed box. The phone is very well built and beautiful - with a gorgeous screen. It was unquestionably new in the box and Mega Mobile is now a trusted seller for me. I have only had it two days but it seems to be quite a battery burner - my battery app is reporting almost 4% usage per hour. This brings up my major issues with WP8: you have to buy apps to show simple, stupid stuff like battery percentage. This is unacceptable and I see why WP continues have adoption issues. Another case in point - say you want to use CardDAV to get your Google contacts on the Lumia? Forget about it - it doesn\\'t work!! My phone arrived with the Lumia Amber version - supposedly the CardDAV issue is fixed in Lumia Black - due out in the future. Also, trying to set up Gmail thru WP8\\'s Gmail \"tool\" did not work well - I kept getting memory errors and had to set up Gmail using the IMAP functionality. For crying out loud, it\\'s 2013, and MS can\\'t figure out how to set up an error-free Gmail connection? Although the phone itself is beautiful - and I really like the hardware - MS has continued to be behind the power curve with Windows Phone 8. Oh - back to battery percentage - there is still no way to have the battery percentage appear in the notification bar on top. Even the live tile - which I paid $1.99 for - only updates once every 30 minutes. OK - enough complaining - there are some nice positives for WP8: MS doesn\\'t scan all of your e-mail (as far as I know, anyway) to try to target ads for you the way Google does - and Office documents look great (for a phone) since it includes Office 365. Overall, the phone is a keeper, because Nokia did a fabulous job on the hardware end. Received the wrong phone that was locked. Very very bummed. Great phone, last one was the Moto G, love the larger screen. To early to tell so far so good ! The phone looks great, I love the phone but no 4G or LTE on T-Mobile network. False advertising by the seller ( Mobile Front ) when they say \" Work GSM Network only Will NOT work with Sprint, Nextel, Verizon etc\" what is the point of buying LTE phone if it does not work!! . Note you will only get H+ on T-Mobile I bought the titan silver 64gb international unlocked. Upgraded from the Sony Xperia Z3 Compact, which is a fantastic little phone in its own right. But this S6 Edge + is lightning fast, incredible screen, the best camera I\\'ve ever seen on a phone and easily the best looking phone I\\'ve seen to date. The edge features are minimal and it\\'s not the easiest phone to hold, especially in a small hand since the back is flat instead of contoured. This is a minor issue that doesn\\'t personally take away from the experience. The build quality is superb, nothing feels cheap at all. And the gorilla glass 4 is incredibly strong so don\\'t worry about it being too fragile, I still wouldn\\'t recommend dropping it, but if you do there is a fair chance it will survive with little damage if dropped from waist height. All-in-all this is easily the best phone I\\'ve owned. I would highly recommend getting the Samsung charge pad to go with it. It\\'s very convenient being able to just set it down and start charging instead of fumbling with the cable, it charges very quickly on the pad as well. The phone arrived in the white Samsung box along with turbo charger, US plug adapter, UK plug adapter, Samsung ear bud headphones and micro-sim port removal tool. All bagged up and packaged in Amazon box. Quality distributer and arrived earlier than scheduled. Highly recommended, 5 stars Phome did not last 2months before it stop working.. Look at the battery part and found that the Red Dot had been cover over with a white dot. .Do not trust the seller...Purchase phone as New. Thanks, this is the second unit of this same mobile I\\'ve bought and all is good Wakala, the display stop work In two weeks!!!! I want my money back!!!!! AN EXCELLENT PHONE. I CAN\\'T PUT IT DOWN. I like it because it\\'s faster than my old phone. Excelent in all the ways... Im so happy exelente My son loves his Moto X. Works well on Selectel Wireless/Verizon network. The phone looks and functions fine with US phone carriers. The box the phone came in looked old and opened but the phone looked new but was the Southeast Asian model. The charging adapters are made for Southeast Asia. Been HTC user for years now and this product is best HTC I had. Awesome screen, wonderful and warm colors with amoled display, what I loved about screen is it doesn\\'t fade in sunlight..!!! Rear cam though is 13 Pix but still lacks the punch, though which pro mode you can create amazing pics. Front cam is best in any phone in this range or of higher range.And yes I opened the box got to phone out booted it, in few minutes alert for Android 6.0.1 update and bammm got Android upgrade within first few minutes of unboxing phone. Now who can give you that amazing service LOVE IT HTC..!!!Yes the speakers a little disappointing but then hey its a new thing they are trying. Let\\'s talk about earphone with Boomsound and Dolby enhance..with in box ear set you get crisp sound and wonderful bass, get a better earphone and DAMNNNNN it\\'s again one the best sound in any phone on this range, it just phenomenal..!!As for HTC sense yes it\\'s as smooth as always and the phone is fast and reaction for apps to open is swift.So yes with price you pay, you get a phone which more worth than what you pay for. Stop listening to people complaining about it looks like IPhone, this HTC device here is better than some brands flagship devices.HENCE THINK TO FURTHER IF YOU FEEL LIKE HAVING IT CLICK THAT ADD TO CART BUTTON..!!! you wont regret This was bought as a new in the box and it was new. They did not disclose that the manual was not in the box.The phone works great Excelente I am totally satisfied. I Don\\'t see a reason for buying an I phone or Galaxy. This HTC is perfect. It is a real smart phone. Unlocked is the best deal. Excellent phone and superb customer service.Phone freezes at times but other than that I have no problems with device. reasonable price and good service great phone to work with great phone great deal! Great mp3 player! I purchased this phone mostly for music playing. I had an HTC Evo 4G LTE and this definitely doesn\\'t compare, but it meets my needs and was purchased at a reasonable price. The operating system is a little slow. It is visually appealing. It is easy to set up & operate. My sound quality pales in comparison to my HTC. I do enjoy it is smaller and more compact than my HTC because I typically carry in a sport band during exercise. Good brings only good thing is the battery cell I\\'ve been using this type of phone for over 10 years. Gave my first one to my wife when she broke her old candy bar type phone died. Used my 2nd KRZR till the speaker got so weak it was hard to hear it ringing. This is my 3rd one and it does every thing I expected.The only thing I found wrong with this phone is a flaw in the screen. There is a 3/8\" black line of dead pixies about 2 rows wide. I kept the phone because I found nothing else wrong and it works ok. Too lazy to do the warranty return for such a small flaw since I\\'ll scratch the screen sooner or later my self. I have noticed that the software on the three KRZR phones I\\'ve had and several others I\\'ve used all seem have slight differences in how some of the features are setup, it just takes a little time to readjust. Over all the camera and size are just right. Good battery life. At bottom page of downloading a map with free navigation [...], a charge for transferring any amounts of data over-the-air should be collected by any phone network. Without a data plan, these providers automatically charge transferring data per kilobyte as a basic included feature. In addition, any Nokia applications should link directly to the main browser of service network on the phone as a default without any exchange. As a result, a charge should be counted on the phone bill when starting an up-to-date of a firmware or downloading a new application over-the-air.Final words, using Wi-Fi without any charge is only when I already controlled it with the following steps (while I do not need a data plan):1. select Connectivity,2. select Wi-Fi/WLAN (on second line because the default network is on the first line),3. select and connect an IP name (already knowing its WEP),4. select Starting Browser within the above IP to surf the web by hitting it after connected. The data transferring onto the phone at this time is not through the phone Network.(If going out of this path in order to select an internet global icon on menu, this action will turn OFF the already connected Wi-Fi instead of turning ON the default network with an automatic charge).5. ALWAYS make sure to select Disconect WI-Fi (on the same path). Indeed, on the Network browser is a must.One more thing, a GPS device unit is the best, and it is completely free for any things. It is also fast, easy, and more technology. A-GPS, one of applications on the phone causes spending more money because of transferring data over the air and through the phone Network. never worked this crap and I have sent back to cellular gallery but amazon fix my problem thanks excelent very good It came in perfect conditions just I expected My phone was exactly as described, in great condition. It was wrapped securely in bubble wrap and came with everything it was supposed to. And it got to me very quickly. I love my phone and am glad I found one here in such perfect condition and for a great price I am very please with this phone so far. I received the phone this week and it works like a charm. It is very fast and responsive. I would definitely recommend this phone to my friends and family. I am an Asus laptop user so I was very excited to find they have cell phones. Great performance, perfect design I don\\'t have a lot of apps or photos or anything on my phone, yet it\\'s constantly telling me that I don\\'t have enough storage space. It\\'s always telling me I need to make updates, yet I am unable to, because there is not enough storage for the updates. Also, the camera is terrible. Works will with ting, and phone bill now a fraction of what it was. Nexus is the only android phone I trust to have software updates for security issues over the long haul. I bought this phone in May and used it in Asia in June. Problem began when I switched to a local SIM card and the time was wrong. When I removed the SIM card the time was correct. So not too happy about that.Now in August, my phone freezes a LOT. I have to restart my phone many times. I\\'ve just restarted it before posting this.On a positive note: the camera is great for taking selfie. It has been over a week since I was promised to receive my merchandise, and yet I still have not received. I\\'m also unable to receive any information relative to tracking the product and determining a location. I am highly disappointed and feel this is bad customer service and unprofessional. Great mid range phone. Latest kit Kat software and all of the LG software enhancements including \"Knock,Knock on\". Very light, large screen with small bezels. Using it with tmobile and gets HSPA+ at around 10 to 15 meg download. Surprised that many carriers haven\\'t offered it for sale. This Phone is OK, it is the right phone for you if it is your first smart phone, otherwise, look something with more internal memory and better camera. SO FAR I HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED WITH IT. I WAS ABLE TO DOWNLOAD ALL MY APPS I WANTED PLUS. NICE CLEAR SCREEN. JUST WISH I COULD FIND AN OTTER BOX FOR THIS MODEL. This is the best phone deal on the market. I have nothing bad to say about this phone. I can\\'t believe how little I paid. Very good product and delivered in a timely manner. The best phone I\\'ve ever had. Works as it should. As described. 63 days after purchase it stopped working. It started with the \"7\" key not working and then progressed to none of the keys working. I tried taking out the battery, resetting the SIMS and turning it on and off. Nothing. The keyboard is toast. So, I have to buy a new phone. DON\\'T BUY THIS PHONE. You will waste your money. As an additional note, the hinges were already starting to get loose. As you know, Amazon only will take stuff back for 30 days so there is no recourse there. The best thing we can all do is post how bad the product is and warn others away. excelent phone and very nice features. The case is beautiful and fits perfectly. I ordered an otterbox prior to this one and it turned out to be a fake. The buttons are.easy to push on this case whereas a fake is not.I highly recommend this case. It fits like a glove. Excellent condition Have a lot of problems, can\\'t hear phone calls have to use loud speaker. Very powerful phone Good Very sharp picture and display. The edge makes the picture looks 3D. The slippery glass face does not give me any problem about finger smudge as some people said on internet. However because the glass is slippery so you better get a protective cover not only to protect it but also prevent it from slipping out of your hand. great liked it Thank You so much. It\\'s a pleasure to work with honest people. I got this phone turned it on and started setting it up within about 20 minites it shut off just get the 2nd version of this phone the screen is a little bigger and its a hell of a lot more reliable BlackBerry 8520 Unlocked Phone with 2 MP Camera, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi--International Version with No Warranty (Black)Excelente equipo, llego en perfecto estado con el cargador y cable USB. Lo unico es que no viene con el idioma español, pero se actualiza el sotware y funciona perfectamente... Lo recomiendo es muy bueno!!! Very good phone Except picture quality. 4G works fine in US. The cell phon never work well Awesome for the price This was a replacement phone for my lost Samsung note 3 which did not have insurance. I like apple because all of my things are apple. Today while I was on my computer, my iphone rang into it. I love that everything communicates! I am still amazed and getting tuned in to this small iphone, it does so much! And it fits in my back pocket! Can never have anything bad to say about apple. Always reliable and does what I need Had it for a couple of weeks now. Looks like stock Android, which is great. Comes with everything you need, including a bumper case and screen protector, which is above and beyond. Everything seems to load up pretty quickly, including websites. Battery seems to last a couple of days at least if it\\'s not being used, which is great.Pros:+ Price! Half the price of most unlocked phones.+ Android 4.4 Kit Kat, and BLU says they\\'ll be doing upgrades to Lollipop in June, so basically the latest version of Android.+ Removable Battery! Thank GOD! It\\'s nice to be able to replace the battery yourself and give the phone to your kids. Or just buy a bigger one without depending on someone to open the phone up. This is the way it should be. Phones don\\'t need to be thinner than this anyways.+ Bumper case, screen protector and even pretty comfortable earbuds with remote and mic are included.Cons:- Unfortunately, every emergency number is programmed in, including 123, which is my provider\\'s voicemail number. I found a way around it, but it\\'s a little annoying.- Can\\'t find any alternative cases to purchase for it, but the included bumper case seems to be more than sufficient, so no biggie.- Hardware buttons not back-lit. A little harder to use in the dark. Can be remedied with software apps, however.- \"Video-Call\" camera seemed a little weak, but this will be used very little anyways. The normal camera, however, took some great photos.- Voice on speakerphone didn\\'t sound so great. But again, probably won\\'t be used that much at all. Using the phone normally sounds fine.To me, this is probably as complete as a budget smartphone as you can get. This might make me jump off of the iOS bandwagon completely. Battery life not great While I love Samsung products, and Galaxy\\'s this is only getting three stars because I can\\'t stand the AT&T preloaded apps. they clutter up the phone and you can\\'t delete them. I love this phone! This is my second one.The seller did a great job being able to do a change of address for me. However when I received my phone and went to activate it, it already had a number and contacts in it, so it was not a \"new, unused phone\" like advertised. Not happy about that part. The phone was too small - especially the keyboard. A +++ phone So far amazing! I have an iPhone 6s, and this has paired smoothly without any downloads or QR code. I bought the \"silver plus,\" which has updated software. My calls are very clear. I can call out and receive calls. I can use the calendar, alarms (vibrate or chimes), I can also set the ringer to vibrate or ringtone or both. I can take pictures, record video and voice recordings, and the sound quality is great. I also added a 32G mini sd chip for storage, and the watch has a handy file manager that shows the album covers to all of music, once I select the song. The Fm radio is terrific; the watch comes with a set of headphones that work with the watch, and the software interface is as nice as the \"Brand\" name that this watch looks identical to. (Sams#$% Neo 2 wink) This smartwatch provides an excellent hands free way to receive calls. It has a quality build and the band is a very soft and flexible silicon-like rubber. My only complaint at all with this watch is that it easily synced all the contacts from my iPhone, yet it didn\\'t transfer the numbers, only the names. Still troubleshooting that. For the price, the look, and the fast phone functions on your wrist, this is a great buy and I am hoping it will have a decent lifespan. Will update if anything odd or unfortunate happens. I am very surprised and pleased for now! :) Goog love it The phone looks great but the home button does not work. I immediately contacted the seller and received no acknowledgement of my e-mail. I was able to adjust the settings on the phone to make it function. I am not satisfied with the seller at all. The HTC EVO 4G that was shipped to me is registered to the original owner with Sprint and can\\'t be activated.I am trying to contact the original owner to find out if it was reported lost or stolen. I got this phone to replace my Motorola Razr 4g phone. Yes...I went backwards. I broke my Razr, and luckily had insurance that covered \\'stupid\\', so I was pleased to have it replaced...until I realized the insurance/phone company gave me a crappy refurbished Razr which was worse than having nothing. Thus I elected to buy this HTC Incredible to replace my replacement Razr, as it was cheaper than paying the stupid insurance fee again. Even for a 3g phone, I am very pleased with the speed, features, and smootheness of animation. I honestly can\\'t tell a huge difference in 3g vs. 4g, and honestly like it better...even though its a 2+ year old phone.I may have made a mistake when ordering though, because I did click on the link for \"9 New from $xx.xx\" and was expecting a new unused HTC phone, as I paid the price listed for a new one. My phone did have obvious signs of use (meaning a few faint scuffs etc)...however I can\\'t be sure it wasn\\'t my mistake when ordering, so I still gave it 5 stars...just as a warning for others that may make the same mistake, make sure the description says new in box, unopened, etc if you are want a NEW phone. Total lie .... I spent $293.00 on 2 of these phones that were supposedly unlocked. They were locked and I would have to pay a minimum of $50.00 per phone to unlock them. For that amount I went to T-Mobile my carrier and bought 2 incredible phones. False advertising is all I have to say. Excelente I think it is worth sharing my story so you can learn from my lessons. I had an \"inexpensive\" model G3 Vigor phone from my cell provider. That in itself was a mistake, a low grade phone for $354.99. In addition I got the insurance for $11.00 per month. Over the course of 18 months the phone slowly degraded: first Bluetooth randomly disconnected from my car and Bluetooth speaker, then the phone ran out of memory so I got an SD card for pictures and video, then calls started dropping, and performance kept degrading to the point where it took a few seconds to pull up the home screen and I had to keep closing apps to get it to perform at least reasonably. I finally had enough and made an insurance claim which was accepted but with a $25 deductible. The replacement phone was a slightly lesser model of phone: an \"Escape 2\" which came with so much bloatware from my carrier I couldn\\'t even install my regular applications. This \"newer\" phone was slower than the original. The overall experience was quite frustrating. So I decided to do my homework and after much research of mid-grade phones I decided on the Moto G4 Plus.I picked up the top unlocked model available in July 2016: 64Gb and 4Gb RAM bundled with a $50 Amazon gift card for $299 so I essentially go the phone for $249. Now that\\'s inexpensive! The phone has 54 Gb available storage with 10Gb reserved for the OS. The octa-core processor and 4Gb of RAM make this baby scream: I keep several applications open at the same time and fly between them without pause. The camera has some very nice features for a phone at this price point perhaps the only desired feature would be image stabilization, but most phones with that feature start at twice the cost of this one. The pictures are much nicer than with my more expensive G3 Vigor, and other phones I\\'ve used: S5, G3. The plus has a fingerprint reader which is awesome for unlocking the screen. After training the fingerprint reader I just touch my thumb on it and the phone instantly unlocks, wicked cool!There are two lacking of the G4 Plus in my estimation: Only 1080p video at a time when phones are starting to record 4K and pretty crummy internal speakers, they work great for phone calls but music sounds pretty tinny. To be fair I haven\\'t heard a phone whose speakers had me impressed, but I have heard better from other phones. That said, I use a Bluetooth speaker for music which sounds great.As for insurance, I don\\'t think it\\'s worth the price when you consider the deductible. I will put $20 away each month ($11 of that comes from the $ I saved cancelling the crummy insurance plan.) By the end of 18 months I\\'ll have enough saved to replace the phone Just received this watch yesterday and got it all set up. I really enjoy the look and feel of the watch. I do not find the size of the watch, at least as of yet, to be too large. It does not impinge my movement at it is very light, can hardly even tell I\\'m wearing it. The band is very comfortable and has plenty of different wrist size variability.As for the set up, make sure to scan the bar code that is programmed into the watch before pairing with bluetooth. I made this mistake last night and was confused as to why the BT notifier wasn\\'t pairing. So turn on the watch, scan the barcode, download the app on your phone, and then pair the phone and watch through bluetooth. Once you do that I have gotten the phone calls, texting, and camera to work.One thing right off the bat I\\'m really disappointed about for this watch is the fact that I can\\'t change the clock interface or the background color of the home screen. It\\'s really not the end of the world, but I feel like this shouldn\\'t be too difficult just to allow users to change. Oh well though.I did try to use the sleep monitor last night and it told me I slept poorly, but I don\\'t believe I did! Something to play with more! I agree that the pedometer probably isn\\'t the most accurate. I am looking forward to get an extra micro card for memory and to put music on this watch. I will hopefully be using it to go on runs and not have to bring my phone.Over all I definitely feel like for the cheap price of this watch I\\'m allowed to really see if I like this smart watch business. EXCELENTE PRODUCTO Todo excelente, el producto cumplió con todo lo publicado Does not fit on iPhone 5c. Big features -Love it, absolutely no complaints. Well, I got the phone promptly, and it works fine. Just a little startling that I can\\'t get a lot of the apps I had on my Android phone, or that are available on i-phones. I imagine it\\'s fairly new technology, and more apps will come, but meanwhile I\\'m reverting to my old Android, cracked screen and all. I may just fix the screen. I was disappointed that I missed a lot of the free sandwiches I could have gotten when Wizards were winning . . . ! Great Phone. I gave it 3 stars because you need and adapter to put in the Micro Sim chip! Also It should have more memory! Accessing the internet is very slow! My Samsung S4 is twice as fast with no delay accessing the internet! I ordered this phone according to the 4.5 and 5 star reviews. I purchased it in November 2015 and it is now December 2015 and the phone cannot hold a charge; dies easily. I have charged it overnight for about a month with no problems. Then on Christmas Eve, I woke up and the first time since I have had the phone, it was dead and I could not get it turned on - it had died and unable to get it to charge. The only things I use my phone for, phone calls, texting, little internet usage when I want to look up something while on the road, and monitoring my webcams. The provider removed the battery - looked the phone over and had to charge it for me at their location. I left there and the same day in the evening, the phone was unable to keep charged up even after charging on the portable charger and through the wall socket. I am very disappointed that the phone cannot hold a charge. I do not recommend purchasing this phone. I would not give it any stars because the cell phone\\'s performance is extremely poor, but I had to give it at least 1 star. Good evening, I wanted to know price and availability for phone battery C806036280T Blu Super Camera Studio C.Thanks Es NECESARIO tener conectado el teléfono al PC para poder actualizar la agenda... Teniendo una agenda de casi 700 contactos no es nada placentero tener que esperar que se carguen todos al sistema. Awesome phone, everything perfect till now! Phone looked good. Good specs was going to use this for a VR project in the $100 range it was great. First off it shipped with a dead battery and in Chinese, but I thought hey not a big deal. So I changed it to English and charged the battery. Then i tried to download a program from the google store. After fighting with it for over an hour. I finally got an alert in the gmail app saying the phone did not support google services and to contact the manufacturer. It\\'s going back. So word to the wise if you need any google store software this phone isn\\'t going to work for you. Amazing phone for a very low price My Niece liked Happy with this purchase. IT DID NOT APPEAR \"NEW\" (AS ADVERTISED) AS IT DID NOT COME WITH ANY ORIGINAL WRAPPINGS/BOX OR EVEN A SEMI SEALED APPEARANCE. THE CHARGER THAT CAME WITH IT DIDN\\'T WORK. IT WORKS, AND ITS THE PHONE AS DESCRIBED BUT NOT QUITE AS ADVERTISED The camera doesnt work. sometimes it doesnt open or when the camera open, it says cant save the pictures. plus is quite slow during us and sometimes just turn off. I dont like it. An Excellent refurbished model, like new!! A+ and I would definitely buy again from this seller.Phone works better than my last Note3! all perfect!! Amazing product!Useful for many devices!Despite that it\\'s designed for Apple products this stand is useful for anyone with electronics! I used to have electronics strewn through out my house and every time I would try to look for a different one I would have to search all over my house! With this charging dock, I can choose what speed I want to plug my device into (how fast can it charge?) and then charge multiple devices at once! for the price the product is not bad but if my phone is in my pants pocket i sometimes lose connection. i have yet to understand the pace count and why i cannot convert it to miles or why the product software that i downloaded to my phone doesn\\'t convert or sync either. Again, for the price it aint that bad. i like the phone. but the key pad is too small to use it. i don\\'t like nokia program. my ringtone play at the music player. i don\\'t know how nokia company program it. and i can\\'t delete their ringtone bs it is locked. next time i will choose windows mobile. I think this one superior to I phones 3 & 4 and possible 5. very nice phone with perfect size and good battery life. The screen is very responsive and smooth. That is the best I owned thus far. Well worth the money. I use it in the state with T-mobile and overseas. good Awful. The SIM card reader doesn\\'t work so therefore I can\\'t get it on any mobile network. Needs to be replaced. awesome phone, very minimalist love iy This smart watch is junk won\\'t charge & doesn\\'t sync with my Nexus 5x very well. Contact\\'s pull up random not what is on screen. Could not get pedometer to work after 1 day read 20 steps before batt went dead. If I could give 0 star\\'s I would. Don\\'t waste your money on it. It\\'s an ok phone not what I expected I need a copy of the purchase invoice This is the perfect phone to send to Cuba for your love ones. They say its has the best reception ever. Highly recommend. More that expect.... love that phone Great smart phone for those of us that don\\'t need the latest and very expensive. Not all of us need to buy an expensive plan, with the latest technology phone. I have a $10 a month plan with Platinum Tel, and don\\'t need a phone with all the bells and whistles, or the hi-tech games. I don\\'t use the browser on it very often either. But the gps and wifi work well, as well as the basics like calls and texts. When I am in an area where it is available it will pick up 4G and other higher modes. It is pretty speedy, and has Kit Kat 4.4.2. There is even space for 2 sim cards if you travel out of the USA. It has all the capability of the Google features, including voice search, and connectivity to maps. Only one CON. It is not easy to see the screen in bright sun, but most are like that. So I get in the shade. Using common sense, this phone is very adequate, and even beyond my expectations. It is terrific for a very affordable price, if you don\\'t have a business expense account. This is my second smart phone and I love it. It will even connect to my Bluetooth system in my car. I highly recommend this great phone !! Excelent Love it! Good excellent product met my expectations nice phone I absolutely loved the 5G way beyond my expectations for my 1st iPhoneThank you C7 everything you told me. Worked perfectly I\\'m a Sony phone user for years but the company lost me with this one as I will never buy Sony phone ever again. This phone is terrible! I got a scratch on my screen the second day after a week my entire screen was scratched up. I dropped the phone once and it got bends and scratches all around the frame, that never happened with my old Sony phones I would drop them multiple times and never had even a scratch. Not only that whatever the phone is made out of sucks but also phone itself does not work well as it\\'s overheating constantly especially when you use camera. Never again Sony! Have to move on to Samsung. I had some reservations regarding this phone, but none of them panned out. The screen size and resolution is great, the phone isn\\'t too big in your hand or in your pocket, and it performs well. This phone is AWESOME. Whether it\\'s the 5M waterproof rating, the FLIR, MicroSD support, the battery life, or the \"vanilla android\" experience, this phone is high quality (The unit has dual SIM SLOTS, but the second one is not enabled. I didn\\'t order it with this feature in mind, but it was a HUGE let-down to see the slot there only to find out I can\\'t use it! WTF, CAT ?!)I don\\'t play games on my phone - I use it for work, so I can\\'t comment on any of that - but this phone is plenty fast for any of the apps I run day-in, day-out. The screen is a little smaller than I\\'m used to (I\\'m coming from a Note 4), but it\\'s big enough. Call quality is great. The speaker doesn\\'t seem any louder than a regular phone - this isn\\'t bad, but if you had a hard time hearing your old phone in a noisy environment, you\\'ll have a hard time hearing this one too. It\\'s a really rugged phone. It also comes with a screen protector - a nice touch! I\\'ll probably be replacing it with a tempered glass one in the future (I like the way they feel better), but it lets you keep the glass pristine right from the get-go.As for the FLIR - the feature that sets this phone apart - it\\'s an amazing tool. There\\'s one minor annoyance - you can\\'t turn off the \"FLIR\" logo which can sometimes get in the way and overall makes the output less useful - but if that\\'s the biggest complaint you\\'re doing all right. No matter what field you\\'re in there\\'s a use for the FLIR. If you point it at a breaker box the temperature will give you a good idea of what\\'s in use. You can see hot spots in equipment in a rack - useful for tweaking cooling solutions whether you\\'re IT, AV, or electrical. If you\\'re HVAC it\\'s a great way to see if there\\'s a blocked coil in a radiator, or see the hotspots in a room - the list just goes on and on. Yes, there are add-on solutions out there (FLIR one), and stand-alone FLIR devices - but they\\'re not nearly as convenient and durable as having it built into your phone.All in all, It\\'s a great device that can compete with any other phone on the market in \"regular stuff\", and then blow it out of the water with the special features (rugged / waterproof / FLIR). I can\\'t put this thing down! I had bought one of these phones about a year ago in India for use there. After returning to the USA I was able to use it here without problem after inserting the sim card from my Consumer Cellular phone into this phone and changing some settings. Being happy with its performance I recently bought another one for my wife from Amazon here in the USA. That one is also working great after using the sim card from her Consumer Cellular phone. I had a little problem setting up the second one but the Consumer Cellular technical assistants helped me do the settings correctly. We are now taking these phones with us for our vacation to New Zealand. We are expecting that we should be able to use them there with locally purchased sim cards. I shall try to make another post in case I face any problems. Its ok!The Blue Life XL is much better! Not the pure! It never worked. This did not work since I got out of its box, unfortunately I knew that on coming to Venezuela. I don\\'t return it because transportation is very expensive.if I could return at no cost I would do that, and buy my beloved Nokia C3-01 After 60 days of use I find this phone meets all of my needs. It has no lag, sharp screen, is sturdy, charges quickly, lasts all day, takes sharp and proper photos, has no unwanted reboots, a nice loud speaker, and no failures of any kind. it is good, but I cannot find it\\'s international version because I didn\\'t find other languages from the phone. The rate of turning on is a little slow. I like the design, it is so ~~cool, and other girls always feel surprising because they always use the lovely ones. Great for the price. So, my phone had some few issues from day one but knowing it was under warranty I kept it. It finally gets to the point I know the problem isn\\'t software and it\\'s hardware. I not only had to purchase a cheap second phone to use just so I could ship it I then get told they won\\'t f\\'in fix it. Supposedly something came lose and they don\\'t care because as far as they are concerned it\\'s \"Beyond Economical Repair\" . What is \"Beyond Economical Repair\"? It\\'s whatever repair Samsung decides it doesn\\'t want to do and jacks up the price to cover themselves. So a phone less than 6 months old is a paperweight.After this experience I will never be buying another Samsung device and would recommend anyone to not do so. There customer service and warranty service is horrible. They even got the color wrong when they had the serial number!To update:1.) It was BER because it was not white. Yet I ordered the Charcoal Black model and the back of the Box w/ the same IMEI as the phone says \"BLACK\".2.) Amazon graciously is allowing me to return it. But this is not Amazon\\'s problem and unfortunately they are having to handle Samsung\\'s bs.3.) My Moto X Pure arrives tomorrow and I will be glad to be no longer using a Samsung device. I purchased this product as an unlocked item. Thereafter, I purchased another one on September 17 also as an unlocked item. One purchase was from the OEM shop and the other one from DLN Enterprises. Since both were shipped first to a cargo company in Miami and then to my home in Venezuela, I have no way of knowing which one came locked other than providing the sellers (I hope one will respond) with the IMEI and pin which is locked, as follows: IMEI: 358263018275487 PIN: 557606BB. Your assistance to solve this problem will be highly appreciated.Best regards, Have had the phone for a week now. Very happy. Really decent phone for the price. Shipped on time. Easy to get set up, it took about 10 min. Didn\\'t come charged, so had to charge first to be used, but that was not a big deal. Would recommend this phone if someone needed a reliable replacement phone. It is being used with a Verizon contract SIM and 32-gig micro SD. excelente this product was not what I expected, had to return the phone. Its been a few weeks and so far so good! I absolutely love my titan e500! Absolute bang for your buck! I\\'m anxiously awaiting the release of the 6.0 inch version!Good HD cameras. Great video quality. Cam is pretty good in lower light environments; user friendly; good screen size. First off, I bought the phone as a replacement of my Sony Z3 dual.I\\'ve always been an android user so decided to stay with them. Current flagship phones are too expensive and I don\\'t want to pay for it so looking into mid-tier phones or older flagship phones. I got an alert these were sold from Amazon (not some 3rd party seller) for 350 so I jumped on it. I figured if it didn\\'t work out I could return for credit and buy the various other phones out there unlocked.Pros+ got marshmallow update fairly quickly through autoloader (real easy, everyone should be able to do it)+ large battery to get me through the day+ big screen, curved sides help with holding the phone+ mostly stock android with a few tweaks that make life just a bit easier+ scrolling with the keyboard is literally the biggest thing for me+ on screen keyboard has the best word prediction solution I\\'ve ever seenCons- a little flimsy, when i type on the onscreen keyboard there is a noticeable sound and bend or flex- wipe the front face of the phone might cause the slider to move- the back kind of feels weird and is plastic despite this being a flagship phoneMiddle* keyboard, so it\\'s great to have a physical keyboard but it\\'s also a bit small. I don\\'t have large hands or fingers and I found it difficult to type using the keyboard. Also to hit the top row it\\'s hard due to the slider portion just above it* wish it was usb C but that hasn\\'t been commonplace until recently.*mute button, i guess it\\'s good???Overall a great phone for the price, the initial unlocked price was just too much. sorry if i dont write very well, i\\'m not in an english language country.so,nice phone, i\\'m very happy with this purchasepros:-excellent audio-good OS-a lot of applications-good screen, confortable for videoscons:-battery life can be short, i recommend to install task killer to reduce the number of apps running all the time. and if you let them running the lag is annoying. Really the task killer is for obligatory downloading.-the camera is bad, but if you want a camera, buy a camera.so, in final words, i love this phone :) very recommended As with a lot of reviews I\\'ve read, the phone was fine at first, then it overheated while charging, locked up and made a crackling sound several times before it finally died about 3 months after i got it.Got no help from the seller and will never buy from them again Arrived on time and just as it was described, a NEW U LOCKED phone. Was super simple to set up when I called Cricket CS.This one replaced my LG phone. Had an S3 in the past and was devestated when it stopped working, and this one picked right back up with where I had left off. Had ZERO learning curve! Very competent unit, I specially love the size and how it feels in the hand. My previous phone was a 5.1 inch unit, but somehow it just didn\\'t feel right.I\\'m finding a few functions that work OK but not quite with the way I would expect, but this is more of a software issue. The hot battery hasn\\'t been an issue with me. Overall, I\\'m quite happy I switched from the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge. I\\'m now waiting in anticipation to the release of the 7.0 version (Nougat), expected as early as next month.By the way, after reading all the reviews, I congratulate myself in not buying the latest compact version, Xperia X. Most everyone says the Z5 Compact is a better phone. It is a vodafone unlocked cellphone. Not factory unlocked as advertised. With the actualization to android 5.02 the battery runs for a day and a half (much less than previously) and the led of notifications needs some help of an app to run properly. But arrived on time and apparently new and that\\'s what I\\'ve been looking for. Great purchase, exactly how described!!! Fast shipment !!! Will buy from seller again!! Thanks a bunch :) I am older and this is in very difficult to use. I need to get a new 4 G sim card to make it work correctly. With 3 g card it will work as a phone but it is not that smart either Excelent... 100% positive... I like this cell-phone This case was for my wife. Color is great. Little thick but you get used to it because it protects well. It\\'s. A great watch does what they say it will. But I worry about the clasp...I know it works now but when the holes in the band get worn , is there another type of band to replace this one?I wear my watch everyday I love this watch!! I just don\\'t want to lose it. My Mother is 80 years old and I purchased this item as it was to be unlocked and compatible with ATT. It comes with virtually no manual. The charger is something that will break easily as time goes on. Once I inserted the SIM card I could not get the phone to NOT say emergency only. It would not pick up the network at all. I searched and searched for details on this phone so that I could trouble shoot the issues and I could not find any sort of tutorial on this phone. The quality of the phone is that of a 23.00 phone...cheap. I have a computer background and have had numerous smart phones, basic phones and so on. I am pretty knowledgeable when it comes to troubleshooting anything technical. My sound advice is do not purchase this phone. If you do, please remember that old saying...you get what you pay for. great phone!!! love it. Battery life is good. Its about the size of the Iphone 6 plus. Love the Camera and video recorder. display is great.do wish they would make accessories for Figo Atrium 5.5. I bought an Iphone 6 plus case and modified it for power and volume buttons.would recommend it to others. it\\'s been 3 days since I got it, screen already showing problems, don\\'t know if it\\'s factory defect or they drop it right before sending it to me.... I am going to return it before it gets worse I bought this just in case I hated switching to an android. As it turns out I love the android. Blackberry has been good to me over the years! Sadly it was time to let you go. This phone was everything you would expect visually for a blackberry, however I never did use it. If you however need a blackberry I recommend this one. This purchase was a waste of money. A full battery charge lasts for about 30 minutes. And the phone is made so cheaply that it almost looks and feels like a toy. Kinda crazy phone. LCD backlight turns on and off all day long, depleting battery. Resets to default some of my personal settings every time I turn off the phone. U$10 would be a fair price for it! ok.. gracias nice Awesome thanks Love it Good item Exactly what was described! Great buy! The product came in a fast & efficient manner, my only gripe is that someone from the company authorized a driver release without my knowledge. That could have been disastrous being it was a last minute birthday gift for my son. I also think you need a stylist in order to operate the menu flawlessly. Good product! Only problem I\\'m having is running outta of data space,.. Me Sad :( Bought this phone over a year ago and it\\'s still doing great. It\\'s a great investment. I like this phone is a good one, the only thing i did not like about this phone is that it does not have flash and a front camara. All the rest works fine, good phone. very good Excellent product..!!! I just ordered the iPhone 4, it is my first time, so i\\'m really nervous about it, i\\'m hoping that it does not come in with defects all over it. I really need it to be good cuz it\\'s a present, just like I said before` I really am hoping for the best. It\\'s estimated to come on the 6th of December. So I\\'ll let you guys know more about it once it comes in. I bought his phone for an upgrade after I got tired of my iPhone 5. I got this phone for my wife. It is a great upgrade from her iPhone 4s as she doesn\\'t like bigger phones like the 6s or 6 plus. good product Looks nice and seems simple to use haven\\'t gotten into it too much because I\\'ve been busy but doesn\\'t look cheap at all Nice little basic phone, with a good battery life. Holds up charge for more than a week with single charge. I have purchased several smart watches for my kids and this one is the best so far. Will buy one more of this. The best case I\\'ve ever had! I keep it on all the time and it allows me to have all my important items, ID, debit card, and some cash, without having to bring my wallet. Not to mention the colors are awesome! It is also very durable; I have dropped it several times, on accident, and it has never popped open or broken at all. The only drawback I can think of is when my flash is on, the case makes pictures cloudy and grey because of the protrusion from the camera. However, I would highly recommend this case to everyone who appreciates convenience! Fast delivery and as aspected. Absolutely garbage. Do not buy. A waste of money. Dose not work when I need it. Used all my mobile data even after I turned mobile data off. Fantastic. This is my second OtterBox for the same phone. It is rugged and durable. Purchased two of these a month ago. So far so good. Works excellent for the price Overall this phone is not for me. It has a few great features though. Way to expensive for what you get.It is too small for me and I don\\'t like not being able to delete the apps I do not use.I suggest watching the videos on youtube before you buy one. I love it 😈🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 The best phone I\\'ve had since my XPERIA Z3! Sony knows how to make a beautiful, speedy, and premium-looking device. If you\\'re looking for an Android-based phone, look no further, the XPERIA Z5 is the best I\\'ve had yet! I ordered this phone from DealFisher and it came as advertised. The phone is new and in a sealed box with all the accessories included. I was worried after some reviews and photos but the phone works wonderfully and is in factory new condition. Very happy with this purchase and would recommend to a friend. The phone arrived on time and came with a very good case. It works perfectly and is an awesome phone for the price. Couldn\\'t have asked for a better transaction. I have already recommended it to friends. This seller sold me a lemon. The phone dropped calls from day 1. I should have returned it but didn\\'t. I bought another phone about 5-6 months later after this phone died on me and cost me a lot of my contacts. I did drop my laptop bag on the phone and the screen cracked about 3 months in. The phone died about a month after that. But again the phone dropped more calls than any phone I have ever owned before the screen cracked. I would say every day I could count on it to drop anywhere from 2-10 calls depending on how much I was using the phone. very good product, I recommend It is working, however because it is unloced it would be nice if they either A: rooted the phone, or B: disabled the carrier updates. I keep getting an update notification for t-mobile, but am using it on another carrier. I loved it great iphone for a very good price Excellent appearance, very good camera,Easily operated. The white collour is beautiful!Yes, I would recomend it to a friend Good phone and charge the supplier, the only negative is that you can not change the menu language to Spanish, I live in Venezuela and I was disappointed that I could not change the menu language even so I use it and I\\'m getting used, with MOVISTAR LINE smoothly.Buen telefono y responsable el proveedor, lo unico negativo es que no se le puede cambiar el lenguaje del menu a español, yo vivo en Venezuela y me decepciono que no le pude cambiar el lenguaje del menu aun asi lo utilizo y me estoy acostumbrando, con LINEA MOVISTAR sin problemas. first apple ever. would never own anything else. so user friendly. The device came with scratches on the screen there was no password given so I cannot restore phone. The earbuds that came with device sounds as if you are using a.m. radio, the charger is loose and have to be wiggled around to charge and the BIGGEST LIE is saying it can get online but all I get is syntax error or cannot find a secure connection. The auto predict on the Tex only works in Chinese or Japanese I am unsure which.This is a 2 star device only because you get video and picture capabilities which one can\\'t complain about the quality due to it being a $30 device, if these 2 items were not present I would rate it a -2 stars. I suggest one not to by this watch unless you just want one.Ken xin da is a better product for around the same price!!This review was by Cavanaugh J. Long Classy The phone\\'s loading time is generally slow and the camera quality is not good. may have just got bad one Nice phone but having problems connecting to the web with my metro I am through with this phone since day one ive been putting up with its bulls***. Ot has a number of issues, it would just reset on me for no reason mutlple time within like 5 minutes. Then sometime it would just completly turn off for no reason and when i try to turn it on it doesnt. So i have to hold the power button and home button at the same time just so it can turn back on. And sometime that doesnt work and i have to wait for hours until it come back on. Sometime i fear that it going to stop working completly.I dont know if the seller was aware with this issue but i am very upset with using it. I regret buying this phone from this seller and i regret not returning it because i thought all the problem would go away in a month and since you could only return product with in a month. I just wish that the seller will read this and offer me a new iphone but sadly i gotta put up with this phone until i have enough money to buy new iphone😪 What a waste if money. This was better than described, phone is like new, with barely visible scratches, no dents or serious damage, came with all accessories even when it did say that it only included was the phone I was wondering how fast and how easy this phone wouldt work,i\\'m very happy whti it so far.It is a great phone and everything on it works as it should.Its a great buy for low budget I fell so in love with the first CHSLING Z8 I got before that I got another one and this time I got the black color because I got the gold color the first time. It has the same features except for the color. It has 5.5 inches screen and it has a 5.1 Android Lollipop operating system. It is lightweight and is also thin. It is super easy to use and its response time is also fast. I like this phone because it has a smart wake feature so I don\\'t have to press the power button to wake it up. Just double tap and it will wake the phone up. I also like the fact that it\\'s already unlocked so there is no need to pay to have it unlocked. It means that as soon as you get it, you can use it right away with any sim card of your choice. Aside from that, it is also dual sim so you can use 2 sim cards from different carriers at the same time. That for me is very amazing. You don\\'t always find a phone with dual sim. As far as I know Samsung and Apple do not have it. So if you want to use 2 carriers but only want 1 phone then this smartphone is for you. It has all the basic features that a smartphone has so it\\'s a gem if you ask me. A gem that only costs $77.99.I got this product for free in exchanged for my honest review. I like it, good price, handle, everything app inside smart phone. I\\'ll admit, I was nervous purchasing this -- the price just seemed awful low and the seller is not Prime. I waited till I had at least a week of use before rating, but after that and a bit more, I am pleasantly surprised and happy with the phone. It is clean and in very good condition as the seller description indicated. There were absolutely no issues with transferring my ATT account to this phone. Product as described middle of the road phone battery life not so good when playing music and wifi sucks I like it, it\\'s working well. The HTC Inspire is not 4G on the T-Mobile Network and I can\\'t get the WIFI-Hotspot to work. I wish the sellers would have advised the buyers that the wifi hotspot doesn\\'t work on the T-Mobile network and it is not 4G. The order said that I would get product one day and I got it way earlier than aniticipated! BF has not activated yet but I am excited about product. Thanks.... Great basic phone. Ideal for elderly people who doesn\\'t need or want smart phones. Small and beautiful phone at an excellente prize. I bought this phone originally for myself and the phone itself it great but it didn\\'t come with a new SIM card so I had to buy a kit. That was my only qualm with this phone. The color is cute and the size is perfect; I love the new chargers, I got this phone after having an iPhone 4 and the charger was always breaking on me so this was a nice change. As paranoid as I am about dropping iPhones ( since I had a iPhone 4) I did drop this a few times before I could get a case and was pleasantly surprised that the screen held up! One thing I dislike about Apple products is the headphones, they are way too big for my ears and don\\'t have good connectivity so I never use them and I feel as if they\\'re going to waste! I did pass this phone onto my mother for an upgrade but I was also surprised when my mother ( a 50 year old non- tech savvy woman) came to me and told me she loved it as well! She found some of the apps to be too much but after she got the hang of how everything worked she really enjoyed it. She very much loves to use the FaceTime option. Let me start by saying the look & feel of the phone was exceptional. I thought I had struck gold with this phone. But I was new to a Android operating system ( I own a I-pad and love the simplicity of the O.S. and it provided me with a rude awakening of what was in store. The \"owners manual\" is one sheet of paper and it starts off with the premise that the \"as delivered\" configuration of the phone need not be explained or instructions need not be provided. hence the phone would only remain \"on\" for a few seconds and then promptly shut down. being \"new \" to Android environment made my situation worse. I did reach \"tech support\" of my cell carrier who markets this phone hoping for some on-line assistance. The person told me I could clear any settings and put the phone in \"OEM\" baseline configuration by a simultaneous manipulation of the power key and some other key which I cannot recall. Doing this did not re-boot the phone as promised - but rather caused the screen to rapidly flash on and off - over and over. When I asked the tech support was this \"normal\" he replied that the phone had \"a total failure\" and was now totally useless. He implied that this was not the first time that this had occurred with this model of the Blu phone. Such a beautiful phone stuck with such poor user manual. So far, a great phone. I did a lot of research when deciding on a new phone in this price range. I listen to a lot of music on the run and the tipping point in favor of the Idol 3, for me, was the front facing stereo speakers.I\\'ve had the phone for a few days now, and I\\'m very impressed with it. The user interface is pretty much stock Lollipop, which I really appreciate. There is very little bloatware/shovelware taking up memory and what there is can be easily removed. The camera is average and takes decent pictures under the right conditions. Bluetooth paired up with all my devices, even the more finicky devices that have given me fits in the past. Call quality is really good and the voices are clear on both ends. Signal reception has been the same as my old phone and I have had no issues connecting to the network. WIFI connections are as expected and I have had no issues.I dropped in a 128Gb micro SD card and it is working as expected. I haven\\'t had a chance to test out the NFC connection, but It\\'s nice to have this capability.The real shocker is the sound quality. The front facing stereo speakers are really impressive. They are loud and you can crank it up with no distortion. Everyone I\\'ve demo\\'ed this for has had the same reaction, \"Whoa, that is impressive\". Are you going to replace your home sound system? Of course not, But you get some pretty big sound from some pretty small speakers. The other surprise was from the included ear buds. I wasn\\'t expecting much, but they sound pretty good for being included in the box. They have flat, no tangle cables and include different size ear pieces. They are a little flat sounding in the mid range, but not objectionably so. They won\\'t replace my more expensive ear buds, but if these were the only ones I had, I\\'m not sure I would be that quick to replace them. I definitely won\\'t be throwing these out.All in all I am very happy with this phone. It has great features and the sounds is incredible. On top of all that it functions well as a phone. In my opinion, this is a good value for the money. Excelente This mobile is exceptionally good with all it\\'s features and performance.Camera quality is excellent with 13 MP and 5 MP. I just don\\'t carry my digital camera after getting this mobile as the pictures are clear.Audio is good.Dual sim option is another feature which attracted me towards this mobile. I was using 2 mobiles and need to get rid of one s it is difficult to maintain 2 mobiles. And this one, as advertised, is working well with 2 SIM cards / networks.It\\'s been few months now I started using this mobile and didn\\'t find any issues with it till date.Happy that I own a fantastic mobile for a decent price.Definitely recommended. Phone does not work with at&t I purchased it for a friend of mine in Jamaica. I called him frantically all day trying to reach him . I couldn\\'t until 2 days later he called me to say the was dead and would not turn on. It eventually did. But still has a tendency to freeze. Would not recommend. For $50. Maybe. Very nice my brother like it Super fast shipping. Great phone for the money! Amazing watch and exactly its purpose.. Setup was really hard, I\\'ve updated the firmware but it kept sending me back wrong password. I\\'ve spent a full day trying using the last 4 digits of the IMEI written on the back side of the watch..When I\\'ve tried to use 0000 as the default password.. Guess what?!! It worked :)All instructions worked fine after this and the watch was performing very well and my 6 years old kid was amazed.. That was releifing as I\\'m based in Egypt it would be hard for me to replace it :)After 1 day.. I can recommend this watch to anyone who wants to stay connected with their young kids. And the GPS works perfectly..Just wanted to share with you all the password trick I\\'ve had as it might work with others.. Didnt work....the seller took it back with no questions...I will buy new next time! Great replacement for my damaged phone. Can\\'t believe the price of this great product!!!! Love it!!! they should unblock short distance texting. Great phone, works perfectly. As an owner of the original Galaxy Note, let me just start by saying most of the issues or \"annoyances\" felt in version 1 have been ironed out in version 2.Everything is better with the Note 2. The speed of this thing is awesome. Windows fly open with easy and smoothness, faster screen switching and all around a more solid feel in the operating system. It is hard to describe. I highly recommend just playing with one at the stores and you will instantly feel its awesomeness.Love the extra features, multi-tasking (although I hope future versions support all apps), better S Note capabilities and touch/feel. This thing takes stunning photos and videos. Love all the new photo add-ons....voice activating the shot by saying \"Cheese!\" is killer. Photo buffs will love all the new Android 4.1 features.Everything shown on the screen is literally breathtaking. All my friends are jealous when I show it to them. Take that tiny iPhone! Battery life is awesome, my biggest complaint regarding the Note 1.Note: Rooting! I rooted my phone, but user beware. If you root this phone, mine stopped getting updates via Kies and the phone\\'s update system. I had to get download of the latest international firmwares, and install it manually. Not hard, and ensures you are always up to date. If doing this, make sure you write down your current Baseband and Build number in Settings/About Device section and get the latest available build that matches the country code. Google it. I highly recommend backing up your current ROM/firmware if you do any rooting.Love the phone....wish it was cheaper, but well worth the money and upgrade from the Note 1. Highly recommend it! Dropped my 6plus on my hard tile floor. The screen didn\\'t break! That\\'s 5 stars in my book. When I didn\\'t have an otterbox case & I dropped my phone only about 2 feet from the floor the whole thing shattered. This case is great. Just what I expected after reading many of the previous reviews...good product, got it on time...happy with it Good experience.. Loved it. Activated fine with no issues. I just bought a PIN code online for 9.99. Using it in my SAM C5 alarm. lo compre y fue entregado al currier el dia estipulado.... aun no lo tengo en mis manos, es decir no ha llegado a mi pais. porq mi currier es un poco lento. cuando llegue el telefono les digo que tal es. Uupdate 2/28/16. phone is a fraud. called Samsung themselbes and the IMEI is not regisyered at all, no insurance, no warranty ability. update 2/11/16 phone is freezing daily, not functioning. I don\\'t know when I can get back home to retrieve this piece of trash. // Absolutely useless as a cell phone. great pics, looks pretty. Completely failes in its primary roll as a cell phone for communication. tested on AT&T and T-Mobile. compared to two different Oneplus One phones side by side and same service. the dBm levels are a joke. phone cuts out constantly where the oneplus one has at least 3/4 bars... This phone does \"connect\" to LTE on both T-Mobile and AT&T once you simply program in the correct APN settings..... it\\'s the signal that is bad / have to be returned... I would have given this baby a 5 stars if it wasn\\'t for the battery life. It goes down at an incredible rate and definitely needs to be charged once a day if you\\'re a heavy user.On the flip side this thing is well built, does anything that other smartphones can do, possibly more and it doesn\\'t dry out my wallet.I think the camera images can be a bit better for an 8MP camera but maybe I just havent found the right app yet.Recently installed AVP the game, works fine. This phone ran about every I i threw at it thus far and i\\'m an appaholic :)UPDATE : 12th July 2013Still going strong. I still hate the battery life of this phone but the performance is outstanding.There isn\\'t a person that I\\'ve shown this phone to that wasn\\'t impressed and I\\'m not just saying that. I will definitely be buying another one for my spouse for the holidays. love iy This phones description does not tell you it\\'s only a 2g phone. And trying to get sim card in is a joke. Worst reception ever. No one could hear me or it was always garbled. Try again Polaroid. Love it It\\'s working fine and I am happy for the phone condition. No problem!!! Thanks you Great watch for the money, battery lasts 3 days on a charge. Only would like to have been able to convert from Metric to US measurements and it being water resistant. yes Product wasn\\'t unlocked as stated in the description. Thank you! I love my new phone!! It works great. The cord was faulty though :/ but I replaced it so no big deal. Bought this to replace my Samsung 4... Much better phone....... Would suggest this one...... Lovely It was good, my brother loves it. Within one month phone stop working I bought this phone in February (sold by and shipped by Amazon); on opening the box, I noticed that it was a Motorola France unit but aside from having to use an adapter on the charger, there were no issues and I enjoyed using the phone until October. Suddenly the phone kept rebooting every 5 minutes. I checked online and found others with the same issues but no solution. I contacted Motorola(USA)who advised me that this was a French phone and I should contact Motorola France! Well I contacted Amazon instead and they emailed me the same day saying that a new phone was being priority shipped to me and all I had to do was print out their return label which they emailed me and ship the old phone back..it was the most amazing customer service I have come across. If more companies were like this, life would be so much less stressful. It does state no warranty on the product description but this did not stop Amazon from doing the right thing. I just got the phone and I thought that I can set up Russian language version. But there\\'s only few languages. And I will return phone back. Don\\'t buy.Bought this for my husband bout 3 months ago,And his phone is all messed up like the phone keeps restarting and the screen turns blue u can\\'t do any Thing on it, and can\\'t return it or replace cause return day is up :/Pay the extra money for a phone. Nice compact design, good value Excellent This smart went out of functioning 1.5 month ago, I cant recharged anymore, a total disaster $39.00 to the water less than 3 months for nothing I do not recommend this product to nobody, totally unsatisfied, no way. I don\\'t kwow 5 starts for this phone is different version.the processor is 1.9 not 2.7 octacore. Because is international version and no warranty. Just as expected. the phone is not worth $5 the camera is really bad and the phone with no extra apps is really slow and using data from the provider is such a hassle to figure out .and so many other things.bottom line dont buy this phone. It is really cute and durable. I love it! My son absolutely loves this phone! Now I want one to go with my iPads, Lol! To be honest I was very disappointed, the phone box was opened and to me the phone did not look new. I had no time to return it berceuse it was a gift for somebody! came in very good condition (new) as it says in the publication recommend a very good article. was sealed, brought all their accessories and released. in Venezuela served to perfection. brings additional memory 2GB micro sd This is my second POSH and my second smartphone. I upgraded because I wanted GPS. My sister is going to take my old Pegasus which is still functioning fine. I love my Titan, definately a crisper display and camera, but most of all it is super fast. I have to get my data working on it though. I don\\'t think it is the phone, I think it is something with configuring and setting it up. Had to do something special with the pegasus too to get it set up. Chatting now with my carrier to see if they can help me. It is a very large screen, so I am going to gift my ASUS tablet to someone as I really don\\'t need it anymore. This phone is faster than my tablet. Funny story with this one. My first phone was stolen off my porch so i had to report it stolen and buy another replacement then once i got my replacement phone my son decided it needed a cranberry juice bath before i even had a chance to activated it. So needless to say it was no good anymore. i put in a drawer a year later i took it out and plugged it in to see what would happen and to my surprise it started to charge, and i have been using it ever since. Even after being soaked in juice and not working for forever it is working now and i love it. Absolutely no complaints Excellent ... I recommend it! Good price, good product! Once the battery drained, it was impossible to recharge it! Waste of time and money!! i got mine refurbished first, they sent me a wrong color, locked mobile. but after i returned it and got the right one... boy is it beautiful! i love it. it\\'s quick, smooth and different :D i\\'d buy it again, never disappointed by nokia... or microsoft or whatever. Nice phone, works well good case. color as expected This is the worst phone EVER SIMPLY THE WORST!!!!!!! I was worried about this phone but now I am happy I\\'m using this phone almost 4-5 month it\\'s really good service everything is good but it\\'s took little long time to get full charge anyway it\\'s great phone I\\'m happy excellent condition hopefully it\\'s going like that I hope Bought for my daughter and she loves it. Loves the size and features. Very satisfied with the purchase. Good phone, functional for my 12 year old daughter. Excellent condition. Was very pleased. VERY FINE! I like this charger. It\\'s small so easy to carry around. It only gives you one full charge which is fine. I highly recommend it. I used to have the bigger version which gave you 4 full charges but this one is just as great! This J5 is unlocked for South Central and NA-only is not a dual sim, just a single Micro-Sim slot; if purchased from seller (lifeline786). The stand-alone second Micro-SIM slot is not even manufactured, just looks like an etched in plastic image of a SIM slot. So for those who are wanting both sim slots manufactured and available to use look elsewhere. FYI: works with GSM band only (like ATT & TMobile, not Verizon). If the stand-alone Micro-SIM was programmed to accept international sims then I\\'m sure you will not be able to have someone else unlock the phone to have it use international sims at all?! So those of you who want to be able to switch between both NA and International sims (or want to switch between two mobile accounts from the same provider or switch between two different providers like ATT and TMobile) without having to switch sim cards might want to look elsewhere.(Product Review)Cons: Samsung are making their phones lighter now by using cheap plastic casing; as a result no impact resistant at all, so buy a case to protect it from drops. I guarantee the phone will break from the first drop!Pros: Internally advancements matches what is stated in the phone\\'s specs. Lives up to the 41 MP. Takes excellent photos. Not fond of the Windows 8 menu - too hard to find things, but I bought it for the camera, not Windows 8 (which sucks on any device). To start the phone was very easy to set up. I\\'m rocking on some tunes right now as I\\'m writing this review. I dropped a 4gig card in it and began downloading albums, no problem very simple if you follow the included instructions. The phone does lag at times but this has not been a major issue. Texting, mms, and phone calls all work like any other phone. I read cnn news daily on the phone which works great for me. Overall for me this was a great buy. The phone works with the new battery but has to be restarted every couple of days because it says it can\\'t read the Sim card. But it\\'s fine other than that. . Excellent Excelent Ítem. Love it Shipped perfectly. Using flawlessly for months on end. Would suggest buying a SIM card with it unless you live close to a Spring store, I had to make three trips to get it working properly. However, that isn\\'t the buyer\\'s fault, Sprint just has a s***ty way to do everything. 10/10 Absulutly great phone for great price, not worse than Galaxy S5 at all! Works perfect, just what i needed. Bought it for $79 promo and worths every penny. First i bought this brand (studio c )for my 10 year old child and works great, then i decided to buy one for me. Fully recomended. Arrived as promised. Phone has worked great. Very satisfied about my order will get more stuff from Amazon excelente I loved this phone. We had some good times. It worked great. The camera was AMAZING. It broke. Smashed. Was destroyed. Here\\'s hoping I can get the screen fixed. But amazing phone. Really great for the price. Just got my phone in the mail yesterday. I have not one complaint so far. The phone is excellent condition. Works great and was super easy to set up. Package was delivered promptly and came within the time frame I was given. Currently writing this review on the purchased device. If necessary I would definitely purchase again!! Thanks Amazon!! GREAT Actually The phone is very good and I love it. I would say it is perfect deal to have this Nokia phone with these specifications. the phone would not allow me to upload music.. This is my second order and I received the phones in excellent condition both times. Thank you again. Great phone, much better than expected I bought this phone for my niece who lives in Iran. And it has been almost a year since I purchased this phone for her and every time I talk with her, she mentions who she loves this phone. I asked her if it was easy to get it going (since it is an unlocked phone) with an Iranian carrier and she said it was extremely easy and quick. There were no problems what so ever.So based on her comments, I am happy with the purchase. Great phone for the price, and it works with all networks. Working fine Everything is good. The minor issue is if you use camera or play games for a long time the phone gets heated. Gr8 Love it I purchased this phone, which arrived new and everything in order. However it came with a Verizon SIM card, which had me curios.My challenge is that i inserted a local SIM card and i keep getting the message \"insert sim\", mind you the SIM works in my other phone so i know its not the SIM.Can someone assist with this challenge and suggest any necessary changes i can possibly make......Though i was skeptical to purchase initially, i did my research before i did, and was a bit more confident. Spend the extra money and buy a better phone. This one constantly freezes up when you use the internet. Not a that great a phone as I was expecting. It works well but could be a lot better. I\\'m disappointed that Samsung leads it\\'s name to such a shabby smartphone brand. Spend the extra money and buy a Galaxy S4, S5, or S6! The lime color is more a yellow with very green undertones. Good Not DUOS!!! beware. I had try twice to get the Galaxy S5 Neo duos but both times I received single sim version and had to return them.I really don\\'t know why they advertise an item that is not what it should be. touch screen didn\\'t work, we have sent it back and waiting for a new one to return. Bought this phone and it was big and bright, very fun from the start. I love windows phones and their OS better then Android, so I knew what I was getting into with the app problem and expected it when i picked this phone out. About for months in, thus phone had trouble charging, it just wouldn\\'t when I plugged it in. Then it started acting right again for a month, then it started happening again with the charging, I rebooted it to try a \"troubleshoot\", and when I went to turn it back on it wouldn\\'t, gave me a blue screen. Now it\\'s my toddlers toy. Haven\\'t even owned it a year and it\\'s already a paper weight. I usually don\\'t write reviews, and this might not happen to the next person, but I wanted to give my experience so hopefully it would help someone I liked the phone but unfortunately I had to ship it back due to me not being able to switch to Sprint service. Everything else about the phone is great including the appearance and performance of the phone. Was everything my daughter wanted. The celphone is too slow\\'. You have no idea how I loved this phone and this was second one. The batter had exceptional life, easy to use, great pictures. You name it, it had it. Both phones out no where just cut of. One cut off before the thirty day period and the other afterwards. Twice is enough. If this is the same company who make the electronic cigarettes, maybe they should stick to making those. However, if they can significantly improve this phone, I would buy again. highly recommended this shop! I send my phone brand new and details that is the opposite of the store citycellular to buy 2 phones and details were I give it an outstanding across the board Love this phone! came highly recommended. Have replaced a chip and will be using it more soon.Thanks. I am planning on purchasing another as gift. Awesome. The phone is amazing a and great value. worked fine with regard to pics and apps and outlook. HOWEVER, last week the phone literally caught fire and was destroyed. A very dangerous situation made better only b/c I was near a sink when the battery began to smoke and then melted into my phone. I feel the extended life 3000 mAh 72hour battery was to blame as it\\'s very powerful and one glitch lead to a really dangerous issue. The phone is melted and the battery burned an orange burn hole in my sink. THANK GOD it was not in my pocket. No contract, no data plan! Yes! I just wanted a phone to text message with. I love the qwerty board! And there is a flash on the camera! I love this phone much more than my old one. However, the phone tends to restart, and pocket dial. Sometimes it drops calls.a The whole thing was a terrible experience. While I\\'ve only had this a few days, so far it\\'s far better than I expected. A few notes about some issues users report.1. The phone as of 2016-05-18 did NOT work on metropcs, so save your time, at least not in my area. T-Mobile and ATT are fine. I believe some of the entries on amazon say it works on metropcs, that\\'s incorrect. It will work on any network that accepts unlocked GSM phones.2. The usb charger is not hard to work around, all you have to do is take a standard length microusb plug, take a hardware store razor blade, and slice away at an angle from the plastic connector down to the metal part, it\\'s really not difficult, and there\\'s no need to worry about having the slightly longer included cable, I just cut away at about a 45 degree angle and a standard cable fit fine. The case is at a slight angle where the connector meets the body, so that side can be cut away slightly more than the other. Without this cable mod, the connection was erratic using a standard usb cable, with it, it\\'s fine.3. Standby battery life is quite good, but when you use it for anything, the battery drains fast, but that\\'s why it only weighs 52 grams, you can\\'t expect a tiny battery to have a long life, that\\'s not realistic.This little phone is amazing, they\\'ve actually managed to cram a full android smart phone onto the device. Typing on it is delicate since the key icons are so tiny, but you actually get the hang of it unless you have thicker fingers.In terms of size, this phone is literally about the same size as just the top lid part of an old flip phone I have.I can\\'t think of a better phone for things like backpacking where you need to have a phone for rides etc, and for me, I prefer this small size, I almost never carry my full sized smart phone because I just don\\'t like that size.I won\\'t know for a year how durable this thing actually is, but honestly, at the price, I don\\'t even care if it fails, you can buy 12 of these for every galaxy or iphone you buy, and they aren\\'t nearly as adorable. It was great not bad for an 8GB phone, i have my music on one drive it come with the case and screen protector 100% unlocked still waiting for windows 10 phone upgrade the phone is windows 8.1 It don\\'t work excellent! it works perfectly fine and is exactly what we reed on the descrption. thanks for your honesty. Is in the best conditions. The deliver was on time. Nothing bad to say. Thank you very much. Just got it in the mail today and I love it! Honestly feels like I paid $900 for this phone. Quality is all there and the screen and sound (dolby digital) don\\'t get me started. Huge upgrade from my Nexus 6. Love it! The product works amazing. But there are some troubles when you update some software. I had used the burst model for 4 years. The discover edition is amazing. But, the user must keep away from the updated. Bought this Lenovo A916 and was excited over the specs and the price. GSM signal drops, poor reception. Not satisfied with the product and just gave it away. Hangs very often. Even simple texting does not work without freezing. Very disappointed. Had to go back to my old phone. I received this today (as a present) and could not be happier. The phone is full featured, got the kit kat update, and has plenty of features to make it work for you. It is the first Android phone that I can say is really decent. Big screen, responsive touch, battery seems decent, and has everything I could have hoped for. Finding cases is a challenge, there are no otter box defenders for this. But the phone is decent and worth every penny considering how much a similar sized and featured phone would cost from other manufacturers. This has the nicest screen of any phone in the AT&T store. Emoticons, picture messaging, etc. all work from the native messaging app as though I was using an iPhone.....very nice. You won\\'t be disappointed if you are looking for a nice Andoid phone that is large, but works well.....and has the nicest screen of any of them.UPDATE: I have been using this for about 3 weeks now, and am happy with it. I had a problem with phone calls cutting off, and was about to return it, but I realized the app killer function (built-in) was killing apps every hour and it must have been killing off my phone calls. That said, I turned this off, and have not had any issues since. If you go to the Android.com/filetransfer site, you can transfer media from a MAC to this phone. I have a Windows computer, but didn\\'t have luck synchronizing things with that. The MAC however, with this app for MAC, lets you transfer music from iTunes, pictures, etc. from your MAC to this phone. A very nice feature that didn\\'t work well on other Android phones I had tried. The LG interface does everything I would want it to do. I wanted reminder tones for notifications on text messages, and LG\\'s native message app has this. It also has a little counter on the app icon that tells you how many messages you have in there that are unread. It also has a great browser that lets you see pages without pinching and zooming; the pages just display at the right size most of the time. Native Android doesn\\'t have features in it that I consider mandatory, like notification reminders - but LG\\'s version for this phone does have that. The experience on LG\\'s version of Android is really good - similar to an iPhone that I was using.The only thing I can say that has been frustrating is that every once in awhile, there are times things slow down. In particular, I have not had any of these until one day I went to reply to an email - something I don\\'t normally do from my phone. At that moment, I saw it struggle and slow down. But eventually it caught up and it wasn\\'t that big of a problem. Was happening when I was in a poor signal area, which might have been more of the problem.Everything else has been good. Bought a cradle charger for a spare battery, along with a spare battery, and can carry it with me if I\\'m going to be nervous about not being able to charge while I\\'m out. If you disable apps you don\\'t need/use (for me things like Google Music, news, books, all of the AT&T apps, etc.) you can really conserve battery. I can get through a day with plenty of battery left, while having light to moderate use. I keep the screen on AUTO and set the max brightness baseline to 70%. The biggest use of the battery is the screen, and if you want to enjoy it at 100% (which is really too bright) the battery will go out much more quickly. Then again, the screen is so nice, you sometimes want to fully enjoy that beautiful screen so you just leave it plugged into a battery pack or something while you play a game, if you want to keep your battery charged while you play.This is a really nice phone. While the LG G3 just came out and is likely a nice upgrade to this, this does everything I need for a reasonable price. With phone prices now being \"full price\" one way or another, I really paused when thinking about buying a \"new\" one. $30/month x 26 months is a long term commitment, for a phone. Basically it is the cost of a nice laptop, for a phone. And while they are a mini-computer, with a phone, I can\\'t come to deal with that kind of pricing. This phone, as a refurb, has not been a disappointment and saved more than 1/2 over buying a newer, new phone. I get 4G LTE (AT&T) and 4G without fail. I have not gotten 3G, but then I haven\\'t travelled to an area that doesn\\'t have 4G/LTE. Hotspot feature works great and doesn\\'t use endless amounts of battery either. This is the best Iphone I have ever purchased. I\\'m very pleased Great product. I love it because I can store more than one card. Not too bulky. :) Received phone in a speedy fashion and am very happy that I got this phone. Works great. Did exactly what I wanted it to do. At work or anywhere I don\\'t want to carry my phone I just insert the SIM card from my AT&T Android phone and the watch performs just like a phone. Easy to use. Bought one for my son. Works great Phone was ok, but it came in an S3 box, battery didn\\'t work and didn\\'t come with headphones. Overall phone works OK. I like all the features of this phone. The only downside is that the configuration and use of the phone is not as intuitive as it should be. i just got this phone it said new lmao it been use more then my old phone oh an said it was un lock not true so dont waste your time an cash ..........junk junk junk .... The 4g Lte sim card has a code on it, so you cant reset the phone with out the PUK code. You can here it ring but you can\\'t talk on it to low and I don\\'t. Use mind now This is certainly value for money. This reasonable phone has a lot of the specifications of a more expensive smartphone. Added bonus was that it came with earphones, a case and a protective glass. Well worth it. Fast delivery. The widely loves it. Good condition Love the style and color. Awesome phone!! I would certainly buy it once again only if they would have future Android updates but they don\\'t. Besides that is an amazing phone. Purchased for traveling abroad to use with foreign Sim cards can\\'t wait to try good phone good price Arrived in perfect condition; no problem setting up and works like it\\'s brand new. Buying a used phone can be a scary proposition, but this seller is honest/safe. Do nt buy it, is a waste of money. AVG Antivirus warned some preloaded apps contain malware. Has second characters I n Chinese cannot delete. Will not play youtube after downloading new app from Google Play. Have to press keys hard. Spell check overides abbreviations and short cuts. It is the worst cell phone I have. I switched to my Samsung mega. Will buy a Galaxy 6 Edge. Lenovo computers and tablets which have owned work excellent. Their phone is AWFUL, I wish I could return it. This is a foreign device not from America. Strange charger and device is not in English. If your American I wouldn\\'t buy. It doesn\\'t work out of network I will be honest about this device i did not like it at first and i wanted to sell it in the next hr after opening it not because it was messed up or the packaging was destroyed because tbh the package and the device is and was flawless (for the device of course lol) but after i downloaded tons of apps (well not tons but a lot more then i had on my last phone) i love this phone. Its fast and its definitely slim. However when i go to go on Facebook i cant go live and on top of that i cant do the emojis like the heart button for the like etc Please bring back that !! This item was purchased for someone who had a similar one years ago and wanted one just like it again. It is an upgraded version and the person is very pleased with the phone. Grand daughter loves it! We live in Costa Rica and the phone works very well here. It is compact, light weight and easy to use. Would recommend it to everyone. I am not such an apple fan but this phone grew on me so quickly that I have been trying to buy it for a while. I bought this for someone but I would love to get one for myself, that is how much I value this particular phone the best Ordered this IPhone 5c as a gift. Out of the box it was locked with a Indiana phone number. I brought it to an Apple Store, where they found the phone defective. Luckily they gave me a brand new phone without a hassle. Very disappointed in this phone.. This will be my 3rd replacement this this time the power switch. I also sent dealer and amazon a return request about 2 weeks ago no word. Ill try again. the buttons are very poorly located. if you try adjusting volume you hit power button or the button on lower right side. I think its for camera function of of some kind. oh yeah NO Instruction manual. I had to download it. Still haven\\'t printed it out because the thing keeps acting up.115-4866059-3015469 How can u see videos on the phone I go on facebook try to look at a video and it just loads and loads but dosent show any thing Its a used phone in perfect conditions works like it was new the best investment that I have made on a phone Great! Just what I wanted Light scratches, works well and the best phone I had so far ... very good design, elegant, comfortable congratulations to the people of NOKIA thousand points just love ... (Recomendable 100% ) The phone did not recognize my sim cards immediately. I contacted the seller who reassured me that the phone was indeed factory unlocked. I kept trying and after DAY THREE is when it recognized them. Also the charger came without the the adaptor. It\\'s always so hard for me to purchase electronics online, but the phone works now however the charge runs down by midday every day. I have to keep it constantly charged. Never read abt this when doing my research Nice phone however GPS did not work, WiFi would not stay connected and my SIM could not be found at times. I was in contact with Posh to try to fix the product. The fix did not work. Hola. Soy de Venezuela. Me encanta este equipo lo puedo usar con cualquiera operadora y tiene todas sus funciones muy practicas.Comprenlo...jeje al igual que cualquier equipo nokia. Excelente marca. So far so good. Thank you I like the fact that it came with a charger and the ear phones but the screen was slightly lifted at the top. Also it freezes up sometimes partially probably because of that. I can say other than that it is a good phone. 100% is recommended Phone have lots of dents that i didnt expect Phone came prompt, bought it for someone else. the back is glossy so beware touching the back. I got fingerprints on the back. My sister was expecting a greater camera but its really good for the price. I recommend it to others. I have problem with my cell the touch not function . Excellent that\\'s all I can say For my first purchase through Amazon I must say I was very pleased with my Otterbox. I will be doing a lot more business from Amazon Great phone I\\'m happy with this one over the X performance. The only thing is I only get 4G on T-Mobile but I love this device. This is the one flagship that allow you to put your App on the SD card big update. I have the blue one; my husband has the orange one. I have to say; buyer beware if you are after a certain color! :) These are DAY GLO bright. His orange phone, which looks nice and muted in the picture online, arrived as hunting-vest orange. It.. is.. so.. bright. My phone is more of a robin\\'s egg blue, but that\\'s OK. Fortunately my husband didn\\'t mind is day-glo phone! His response was, \"Well, at least I can see where I put it.\"For the hands-on usage... It\\'s OK, but it has its quirks. For some reason, it hesitates what seems like forever after I select the \"text\" app and try to send a message. I have to continuously tap my finger on the \"type text message\" box to get it to respond.Hearing on it isn\\'t the best; I have the in-call volume all the way up and sometimes have trouble hearing my calls unless I\\'m in a quiet area. If you\\'re in an area any louder than a grocery store (or watching a movie for example), you may have some trouble. It has a great loud ringtone though!I wish I could completely turn off vibration. I still get a vibration when I receive a text or when the phone is in-call and it \"connects\" to the number you dialed; even though I have vibration and haptic feedback turned off. Strange. This might be user error, but their manual doesn\\'t specify very clearly if there IS a way to completely turn off all vibration. I\\'m not too bothered by it as I\\'m just using this strictly as a mobile phone and not an entertainment device. If it goes off once in a while, I won\\'t die. I don\\'t have battery/space hog apps such as Facebook installed, so my battery life is very good. It can last two days before I have to charge it.The screen is hard to see sometimes. You have to angle it \"this way\" or \"that way\" depending on what you\\'re trying to do.All in all, it\\'s a solid phone and it\\'s good for the price. I don\\'t make many calls, mainly just use it for texting. Once I find another phone that\\'s a little more user friendly with more options, this phone will be my trusty back-up device! muy bueno. best phone ive recieved. looked brand new with very few scratches! Great phone love it The sender got this phone to me in a nice amount of time but the phone does not have an updated system at all. Even the marketplace is out dated. The phone was not worth it. Full HD, super funny to draw and take notes. iPhone arrive at the time completely new , but box was open , I mean It came with an plastic cover like the new one from apple but it was obviously open previously because inside the phone there was a SIM card , I was not surprised because I read that before in the other comments , yesterday my phone was inhibited for minutes , ive read thats normal un iPhone 7 plus , so Im happy for the Fast delivery but kinda worry for the product Very good, excelent cell phones! Great performance and a pocket size. I love it. You will. GREAT! Wasn\\'t what i was expecting Phone is perfect, works great on tmobile service. Love the flash on the front camera. Awesome, gift. Thanks. Very happy with the product so far. Camera is a little slow to focus. Excellent battery life. I bought the Cell phone for my sister and She saids is perfect. i love it! Haven\\'t use it.Hopefully works as posted on the website.Its a gift for someone and will be given by February. Buenisimo I e tryed different plans doesn\\'t work waisted like 300 bucks on it Although there is no sim card needle in the package, the product is awesome. Thanks. This is the second one of this phone that I buy!! I think is just amazing!! so fast and with super great camera!! This product is very nice for the price but I really don,t know if this is a China version because when I open it first there were Chinese writings at the beginning and some of the things I try to access is in Chinese language. It have a lot of great features so I hope it work well like my older version I already bought this phone(Samsung note 4 verizon) but I want unlock it with code by bying it is possible? Does everything I want a cell phone to do and it came Packaged in original box and looked like it was never used. The 5 stars applied to aperture shots. I bought this phone primarily because of Leica and heard good thing about Huawei quality product. Both are not disappointed . The picture of the phone not really justified how well made of this product until you unboxed it and hold it on your hand. The selfie camera comes with native beauty photo mode which pretty much can do a lot of cool thing to your face and body, not that I ever going to use it. To my surprise it already installed with Android 6. The low end spec strangely the only one that support NFC, another reason I chose this model besides the lowest price. It could be my next choice for next phone, Huawei, if they keep doing good thing with up to date Android releases, killer camera, and reasonable price with this good product quality.---- additional after a couple week usage ---The phone is not a 5 stars phone. I own MotoX Pure Edition and Samsung7. The phone was slowing down after a couple day use without rebooting, while my other phones could go days and week without reboot and no decrease performance. Yes this could be because of 32GB RAM capacity. Therefore I put down to 4 stars review. I\\'ll defly bring this phone for traveling however as the second phone. The primary use for this phone just because of the camera. buenos dias el dia 22 de agosto le compre una blackberry 9780 necesito la copia de la factura original para que pueda llegar a venezuela el equipo llego sin factura phone has querty keyboard which my wife wanted. Same phone as I have.Phone is good but has a tendency to go to \"locked\" too often making it onerous to use. Display is broken I bought this with the intention of using it on WiFi for a while to decide if it would make a good phone. I still have not connected it with a cellular service, so I can\\'t comment on call quality, but I do intend to. I was a little concerned about the screen size, the battery size and the amount of memory.The memory is workable if you remember to shut down apps that you aren\\'t using. It\\'s less tolerant of lots of apps running in the background than, some higher end devices like my Nexus 7, but with a little attention, it\\'s not a problem.The battery, while small by today\\'s standards, is adequate, given the small screen and modest processor power.The screen is decent. It doesn\\'t like steep viewing angles, but despite its low resolution, still looks sharp, thanks to its small size. Speaking of size, the screen is legible and usable despite its size. It just displays less information at a time. it slows me down a bit, but it\\'s a trade off for the small size of the phone.Cameras: not to be used for anything important, but they work for still shots and video.Bottom line- this is a cheap phone, so adjust expectations accordingly. That said, it is a capable phone which does the things you would expect a smartphone to do, with the added benefit of being very cheap, light and tiny. Works great! Bought it used and had no problems whatsoever. Very happy! Im an Apple and Android user traditionally. Picked this sweet little puppy up as a back up. Keyboard clicks great, internet is reasonably fast, condition of the device was great. Great little buy out of contract for $180. THIS IS A GREAT REPLACEMENT PHONE. HAS ALL THE BELLS AND WHISTLES AS A MORE EXPENSIVE PHONE. THE SPEAKEER PHONE IS GREAT. THE VOICE CALL ID IS VERY UP TO DATE AND THE CAMERA VERY GOOD. Good Dont hesitate to buy this phone, it is like brand new. Mine doesn\\'t have a single scratch and it works perfect on my tmobile Carrier. Great phone replacement for our other phone. Shipped fast and for a used phone, it works perfectly and there weren\\'t as many defects on the phone as described. It was better. So far so good. I would recommend Nice phone for the money. ... It\\'s nice and fun Excellent phone, works perfectly with AT&T, love it. Reached on time. Yet to open the package... It\\'s a gift for a friend Brilliant phone.Somewhat clumsy software optimizations create actual usable battery life. Last 3 phones would get 1.5-3 hours SOT at most (Note 3, G4, S6). This phone gets 4-6 hours SOT.Nice screen.Great updates so far. On the 9/1/16 security patch as of mid-October, with 2 OTA updates in past 3 weeks.USB-C is much nicer ergonomically than microUSB.Works out of the box with Cricket and Straight Talk.Only downside right now is limited case availability. None from major case vendors right now. Using the OEM clear case, which is too minimalist for my tendency to drop the phone every now and then. Works perfectly. Arrived on time. All you really need. Excellent phone I had a Samsung Galaxy S3 prior to this and it broke. Did not want to sign on for another contract or spend $500 on a new one so I bought this for $150. Pros: Internet speed and connection are good. Nice size. Good screen resolution. Cheap!Cons: Photo quality is pretty poor. Keypad is a major pain: 50% of the time, chooses the wrong letter and provides really ridiculous word suggestions. Takes me double the time to write a text than it did with my old phone and I wasn\\'t thrilled with the text messaging on that one either. Forget about writing an email because you might lose your mind in frustration trying to type it. It will do for now. Lumia 920 operates still as a top notch, even after 2 years of it\\'s launch. My friends liked my current lumia 920 and ordered 2 new units for my friends. This phones doesn\\'t work well.. This phone is amazing and i bought this phone without no problem and i am very happy for amazon.com and LG G3 . I am sugguesting everybody get this phone quickly you have feel better and better thank you amazon thank you lg :) Everything excelent! I love it Phone was in great shape just as promised in original box daughter was very happy. This phone is awesome, except for that when I received it, the microphone didn\\'t work during phone calls, unless on speaker. And even then, it was cutting in and out. The phone itself is great. But this little problem is widespread. Make sure once you buy this phone, it is in full working condition. Other than that, its an awesome phone. great product Love love it! Protects the phone so well and is a gorgeous color. Love it, good price to! I liked the phone and delivery on time I bought this phone in April of 2015. Besides a little phantom scrolling issue (where the screen would move while not being touched) the phone was okay. Not spectacular, but definitely sufficient for calling/texting/photo purposes. I\\'ve never had to add a memory card to it so the space is also sufficient as there is virtually no bloatware.The real problem came around month 5 of owning this phone. The charger that came with this phone would no longer charge it. I bought another from Amazon and it charged the phone for almost 2 weeks before it stopped working. Because I assumed it was just a malfunction with BLU chargers, I then bought a series of other chargers, one LG charger from my local cell phone store, one ONN charger from Walmart and a portable charging bank by Motorola (which is really great!) from Groupon. Suffice it to say, none of these charged my phone very long. They do, however, work for my 2 tablets and my son\\'s phone.So I contacted BLU customer service, they asked me a series of questions and then sent me an email to a link asking the same series of questions with a request to upload a file containing my Amazon order receipt. I was told to call them back after I had uploaded the file. I did as instructed and was greeted by a very rude customer service agent who just shuffled me off to a \"warranty claim processor\" who needed me to then ask me THE SAME SERIES OF QUESTIONS AGAIN! So after this 4th round of Q&A I was tired of talking to them and just asked when I\\'d receive a replacement phone. The rep told me I would have to pay to ship the phone back to them and would not receive a replacement for a month! What am I supposed to do without a phone for a month?! Please save yourself a headache and never purchase from BLU. They are inconsiderate, not at all customer-focused and obviously make sub-par products that they do not stand behind. looks and works very good. has a small scratch on the screen, but I guess that is why priced $50 lower than others. --does not bother me as long as I saved $. Love this phone! Excellent !! This is a pretty good phone for texting. It has a nice keyboard, and a 1.3 MP camera. The first one that came had a bad MicroSD slot. Cellular Gallery Inc. was really good about sending a replacement. They even pretested the MicroSD slot before sending it. This replacement unit works great!A small snag - AT&T needed to enter the serial number into their system before the SIM card would work. That necessitated a trip to the AT&T Store. good prodduct All we have acquired smartphone BLU brand, we know that we are excellent devices, particularly recommend. I\\'m really happy with my purchase. The phone is working great. I\\'ve had it for about a month now and no problems with it. I\\'m really happy. Stellar phone for the price. To break it down:+ screen looks great+ great battery life, usually still have 50% left by the end of the day+ takes a 64GB SD card (sandisk - haven\\'t tried other brands)+ good wifi and cell reception+ no noticible delays when running apps+ the mono-speaker gets pretty loud (though it\\'s obviously still a phone speaker, so don\\'t expect miracles)+ feels solid (doesn\\'t feel cheap)- camera doesn\\'t have autofocus. I didn\\'t think I would mind this, but it turns out that the chase quickdeposit app requires an autofocus camera- the headphone output is quieter than expected. it\\'s fine for actual headphone use, but when I hook it up to my car I usually have to crank my car volume about 2-3x as loud as normal.+/- it runs kitkat. that opens up a lot of the newest features, but it also means that you have limited use of your SD card. You can google \"Kitkat SD card\" for more info, but it was something I didn\\'t realize when I bought it.Of course it would be great if the phone had LTE, 4K screen, etc....but for the money it will be tough to beat. Gizmo trader took great care of me and the phone was described to a T down to a scratch on the corner......very good company and even better products I bought this phone to replace my Blu Vivo which I loved but broke. I thought this phone would be an upgrade, but it\\'s terrible. The battery does not last any longer than any other phone and the phone freezes almost constantly. The screen brightness is also very dull. I\\'ve been trying to return it but the only response I receive from Blu is to do a factory reset. I know it was a used product but the seller never told me that the Volume button was removed from device ....Anyway After I tested the Phone it worked very fine and the problem with the Volume Button... solved with an Android App that sets all sounds from touch screen. I love the item that I got it work very well I really enjoy this casio phone. If youre not into smart phones, this one is a gem. Its a good phone. Battery doesn\\'t last Beware!!! I just bought this phone June 13th worked great no problems July 15th no longer works in the box is a piece of paper that states 90 day limited warranty but when I tried to return it states 30-day......BEWARE!!! Excellent Excelente I was verrrry leary ordering this phone thinking that it probably would not work and so on. Thank god Amazon has a great return policy! Turns out, the phone looked brand new!!! Arrived fast and phone works flawlessly. The phone I ordered was unlocked and I was able to put in international SIM card and works great! Phone was exactly what I ordered. It was a much needed upgrade from a flip phone. I had a lot of fun with this phone. My 3rd smart phone, 2nd android phone. Unusable out of the box, transformed into a very nice phone thanks to devs, CM10 and other jelly bean based roms. No longer have it but had fun rooting and loading different roms back in 2010-11. Will always remember this little guy. Loved high res LCD 800x480 on 3.7\" is still very nice today. My new 4.5\" has lower ppi than this. Everything looks vibrant and nice. 3MP camera is better than other 3MP in its class for stills and video. I was excited to use the front cam with skype. Was my first smart phone with the front cam. VGA but still useful. Removable back cover, replaceable battery, if that matters. Takes standard size sim. Runs different GPS apps, almost never had gps issues.My only complaint the ringer is very quiet, compared to other phones i\\'ve head by Nokia and LG. The volume rocker is very soft. I often accidentally pressed it with my fingers. Out of the box needs to be rooted, debloated, custom-rommed, app2sd a must due to low internal memory. Otherwise its just a laggy POS. It\\'s ok Awesome phone Got it on time and works great! I was a little skeptical but so happy once I got my phone delivered. You get what you pay for right? This got me through way too long of a period after I broke my phone. Couldn\\'t really stand it though, although it had its perks. Taught me to spend less time on my phone and enjoy life a bit more. Screen has an effect that kind of gave me a headache to look at it. Sort of a blur effect. Super slow. Texting is faster on an old T9 flip phone. I put this is 3 stars because it\\'s ok based on the price. Not horrible, and probably compares well to your other options. Was nice to upgrade to the Galaxy S7 from this baby. EXCELENT bueno great I cant believe this phone didnt come with a charger. No return label in the shipping box. soo disapointing. Excellent phone! I like how they customIze the icons as they are colorful. No need for a separate SD card, the memory is built in. It comes with free screen protector and back casing. It\\'s very light weight and wide screen. The camera takes great photos. Highly recommended. yes As described & in great condition If you are looking at this phone in this day and age, you probably know what you want anyway, and you will not be disappointed. great phone, so far no issues and the fingerprint scanner is great, never thought i would need one, but now that i have one, i don\\'t think ill ever go back. great budget android for anyone looking. The Lumia 640 XL is an excellent phone. It takes amazing, very sharp photos that match the quality of phones that are three times it\\'s cost. It runs very smoothly despite it\\'s low-mid tier processor, which translates to having better battery life without compromising user experience. I\\'ve been using this phone for weeks now, and it has not once gone below the 50% mark - even after having it on for nearly 2 days!Additional pros over iOS and Android:- Glance screen: The Lumia 640 XL gives users the option to always show the time and notifications while eating up very little power.- Double tap to wake / sleep: You can double tap the screen, or the navigation bar to wake and put your phone to sleep respectively.- Tiles: This is actually a huge one for me. People often dislike the tile interface, but I personally love it. It\\'s so easy to find out what tasks I need to attend to on my phone with just one look at the screen. If i need to respond to someone\\'s text, I won\\'t forget because a number is going to show up on the text icon, even if I\\'ve cleared notifications.- Synchronization: This is my second Lumia, and the ability to automatically bring over all my apps, and settings from my older phone made the upgrade process so painless.- Smoothness: If someone handed you the phone, you would have no idea that this is a sub $250 phone because of how smooth it is. It\\'s build also screams quality.Advantages over iPhone:- The case is removable! This means that if you scratch the case, or scuff it, or crack it, it\\'s always replaceable for a mere $15. I really like this compared to my old iPhone.- Additional Storage via SD Card: You can add an SD Card to your phone, increasing it\\'s on board storage by up to 128 GB for less than $50. (I got the 64 GB micro SD available on this site for $23)Disadvantages over Android:- No Widgets: Widgets were really nice on my old Galaxy S3. I wish the tiled interface would be a bit more interactive.- Facebook Messenger: The Facebook Messenger app on Android had a \"widget\" that would always be there despite the app. This made it easier to multi-task while on Facebook Messenger.All in all, I have to say that this is the best phone I\\'ve owned to date. I\\'ve used the Galaxy S3, iPhone 4s, Lumie 635, and now this. The fact that this phone is sub $250 unlocked and off contract and can effectively compete with flagship phones three times it\\'s price makes this purchase an incredible value. I was skeptical about getting this phone over the E71. All the reviews attacked this phone as not worth it. Well I sadly don\\'t have a E71 my jump was from the N79 to this Business phone. My decision was based on the 100 Dollar difference against the Same OS I was using, Symbian S60 3rd FP2 and the 5 MP Camera. I could successfully upgrade most of my N79 apps into E72.Software:The huge upgrade aside of the business orientation model is the stability.I have found myself listening music, playing Snes on a Symbian emulator, with facebook and twitter apps on, my opera browser, chats (whatsapp), etc, abruptly interrupted by the \"email notification\". All I have to do is go to my Home screen with \"end conversation button\" (or email button that I haven\\'t get used to yet) look for the new email, reply it and go back to my game or any other program I require.I like installing all type of stuff I found on the web. Pretty much everything runs. I have more problems with the screen orientation 320X240 than the actual phone managing the application. I have opened heavy PDF that my N79 would either crash or take fore ever to open.The OVI MAPS on this device is way faster, way more clear and with more options such as own voice, and street names. This one is amazing because streets names change in this city every corner. You don\\'t take too much attention to the phone \"visual\" directions since it tells you the next turn is at \"Coyoacan Ave\" etc.Hardware:The hardware is fine, not the best I have seen, my N79 was made in Mexico and felt solid. This one is made in China, still it\\'s just different design. The power on Button is \"loose\" it feels like it will fall off, although haven\\'t. The little connector (miniUSB) is covered by a thin plastic thing that I have never like it. I treat my phones really well but I don\\'t know if it can handle a not so careful user. People complain about the sensor Navi key, I totally agree. I dislike it. Its ok for browsing in the web, but for moving around in the menu, well I just turn it off, problem solved.I don\\'t regret getting this phone, It fits me for all my needs so fat. I have had this for a month now, it still has a lot to go. Actually I like the phone. The instruction book you need a magnifying glass to read. Even with glasses the print is just very small. I went online and printed the book from there. There are no outlets that carry a case for the phone. So I ordered from an Amazon seller and found what they said was a BLU cover for a Dash Jr. It looked like it, but it was not what it looked like. Back to the phone, I am still learning it, and am enjoying it. Carol I am impressed with the quality of this phone,The Xperia Z5 display excellent color reproduction and sharpness, has an excellent image, the glass screen feels sturdy, the software and hardware environment respond quickly and smooth, I have been using continuously and has no overheating by the continued use of streaming as z3,The Xperia Z5 is very well put together, with Gorilla Glass 4 on the front and back, an aluminum frame and rubber bumpers on the corners to help absorb shock if the phone is dropped,The camera has truly excellent auto-focus,regarding the battery of sony phone I do not see a big difference compared to other phones like Samsung or IPhone S6,but The biggest departure in design terms, is the look of the power button. Sony’s trademark protruding chrome-effect circle, which has been around for years, has now been replaced by an elongated lozenge, slightly inset from the edge to prevent you accidentally pressing it.I particularly recommend this phone to a friend. This phone was great up until the 2 week mark or owning it. Now it freezes all the time and the screen goes black and wont turn on again until you take out the battery and reboot the entire thing. Not to mention that it has horrible ram, practically no internal storage, and you cant run 2 apps at once. I cant listen to music and look on Instagram, WTH is that about. I do not recommend buyng this phone for anyone unless you truly hate this person and want them to go insane. I have only had Sony cell phones for over 10 years. Nice phone and very happy with this purchase. Loved this phone until the day it felt and the screen got damaged. Unable to find a replacement ever since. I\\'ve been using it for about a week now. It\\'s a great phone for the price. The large size is taking some getting accustomed to, but it does make everything incredibly easy to see. Exactly as promised BUENO First time I received the phone from the seller everything seemed fine, but after 2 days the loud speakers stopped working. Then I sent the phone back to the seller and he told me that he had another phone and that he was getting it tested by Apple to make sure everything worked properly. Come to find out after waiting 2 weeks for a my phone..that all he did was repair the same one I had sent in. Do not ever buy an item from RolyG! You will be disappointed! I was very pleased with the phone. My daughter loves the phone and it sends and receives text messages very quickly even though we\\'re using a t-mobile sim card in a Verizon phone. I had a question about the phone and the seller got back to me by e-mail withing a few hours and politely answered my question. I will definitely buy again from this seller in the future. product is as per description... It is just awesome. It came quite on time and as described. I will recommend this sale to anybody i know I just received this \"unlocked\" iphone 5s two days ago and was happy until I but I tried to put my sim card in. No service so I called my carrier T-Mobile and oh guess what the phone has a carrier lock on it with guess who T-Mobile. Needless to say I\\'m pissed and without a phone or money and have yet to get a reply or a refund. ZERO STARS!!! Awesome Phone! Great Product! Very Satisfied. very bad experience with buying this phone!I disguta the product was offered as new, and not buy it as such and I was eviado used equipment that only lasted four weeks in use, since the instrument housing plate looked new but had no production values\\u200b\\u200b, is had that call records, text messages in the mailbox and out and cajaa was with the seals opened, it tells me that the computer was in use beyond ..now the computer is not available until today I could not fix anything, he as lost phone ..Absolutely not recommend anyone to buy this product time ....very disappointed by the deception of what I get ...thank you very muchThe phone I bought as new and used sent me Fits my S5 with no problem. excelente Absolutely love this phone. Would buy again Really good Worked well for a while then all of a sudden people can\\'t hear me when I call or when they call me. Yet the Mic works for recording. Not happy with my purchase great replacement phone for my daughter. put in old sim card and it fired right up Upon arrival keys i, k, b and number 7 did not work. None of the function keys worked and the camera button was broke. The only upside to this purchase was Amazon\\'s return policy. This phone is horrible the speaker and volume is very low. Do not know what to make of this The Samsung Galaxy S3 is a very good product, l like it and have had no problem with it so far. I was very happy with the phone I got for the price. Everything works great. My only complaint is I didn\\'t receive any headphones. Wasn\\'t able to handle mid-demanding apps and life-spawn of this is less than 9 months. Not a quality phone. I have been a loyal Sony Xperia Z1S and Z3 user and wanted to upgrade to the Z5. Xperia Z5 crashed repeatedly during startup process and then continued to do so with minimal use, even trying to open main menu screens. Factory reset did not fix anything. Returned it within a day and I\\'ll have to wait for the next model to see if they ironed out the kinks. Excelente recomendado 100% Been very happy with this phone so far. It\\'s affordable, and adequately meets basic needs. I\\'m using it on my AT&T service with no trouble at all. It won\\'t handle graphically intensive games or apps very well, but it\\'s not really intended to. The available memory is very low, but you can find a card for cheap to increase the storage. I selected an 8gig add on option when I purchased the phone and it has been enough for my needs.It has great sound with audio or video, the touch screen is responsive, and not overly sensitive, and it has a good picture. Overall a great phone for a good price. I\\'d definitely purchase this brand again. This is the wrose phone I ever had, The phone stops working all the time, it locks up and I have to remove the Battery to rebot it. It\\' s also out dated, most of the apps I use would not even down load and some wouldn\\'t run. The recessed on botton may have seem like a good idea, but it\\'s hard to use when you have to look for it. I\\'m going to try to return it if I can I have had for a while now. Works great! I wrote my review of the BLU studio 6.0 for the case. The BLU studio 6.0 has some design flaws. One has trouble picking it up without changing the volume &/or turning the screen off. The controls should have been placed elsewhere or perhaps sunken in. Also, the battery runs down quickly, often less than a day; a problem I\\'ve never had before. Having problems with phone after a month. I believe this was a refurbished phone and not a new phone. I\\'ll save money to buy a brand new Samsung Galaxy cell phone. It\\'s worth it. such a great phone. No issues at all. I love it My Cricket siM card works Great Transaction, Outstanding phone, a bit pricey but the best possible at this time. I love the HTC smart phone. Easy to use and has everything I need on a phone I like that Battery don\\'t work Very pleased with purchase. Works as described. A very novel item that will get many comments. Not for people with large fingers. Screen ivery clear and bright. Only a 4 gig memory but it has a slot to upgrade with a SD card. Since price is low good first phone for children. Excellent! Love it Does not support 4G / LTE. Great phone! In fact best phone i ever had for now. With the Otterbox defender case that I bought, it will stay just like new for years. Great battery, light, alot of features. Also as I leave in Haiti, this model particulary works on both Digicel and Natcom (4g on Digicel and 3g on Natcom) When I first got this phone, I didn\\'t know how to use it but eventually, I got to find out about the features the phone has. One of the features the phone has is that it has a flashlight app which I can use to search for things in darkness, a f.m radio app, and a phone manager app which allows you to scan your phone for any viruses, closes any open apps, etc. Apart from those apps I mentioned earlier, there are other features the phone has as well, but you would have to buy it in order to discover them. The only drawback is that the phone freezes sometimes, but other than that, it is OK for any person to use as long as there is a sim card in the phone which will activate the phone service. Just ok phone😩 Love this phone! The only frustration I had was very small, I dislike that when you type a colan and a close parenthesis it automatically costs to an emoji. So, :) and :p as well as others would be corrected to emojis. Other than this small problem, I love everything else about the phone! Great sound, good memory, works well! Bought this for my grandmother to replace her budget Samsung smartphone. MUCH bigger and better screen, she can now easily read anything on the phone. The speakerphone feature also works very well. Camera isn\\'t top notice but I would say it is slightly above average.So far no complaints from her! Well worth the price for a carrier/contract free phone! Worked for a while like a year or so.....then suddenly stopped. Takes pictures horrible. low storage as well. Great phone for the price Very satisfied with the purchase, the product was received in the due date, product quality and very good transaction with the seller, works to perfection with the operators of the country very happy with the product quality 100% Seems to be quite good. Had an iPhone 5C and this phone for the price I paid was a great upgrade in my opinion. I bought the phone so I can use overseas and it worked. Also its easy for my mom to use, and the price is good. The Samsung Galaxy S5 is a fantastic phone, but the one I received from this seller was defective. I didn\\'t find out until after it was activated, so this presents a big problem for me. The problem is that the it won\\'t charge the battery. The first time it charged the battery to 40% and that is when I had to take it to the AT&T store to get it activated. When I returned home, I put it back on charge and let it charge for a couple of hours before I returned to get it. The phone was not charging, and it was 1% changed. I reset the phone and it charged again, when it got to 30%, I installed the update. I thought the update might fix the charging problem. After the update, the phone was reset while it finished installing, that all went fine. I saw that the phone was charging so I left it on the charger and went o sleep. When I returned, 7 hours later, it had stopped charging, and the phone was charged to 19%. So all the problems with the phone have to do with the charging. I also tried the finger print scanner as a method to unlock the phone, but after it was trained, it took way to many tries to get it to read my finger correctly. It was a good thing that the phone had a backup password that could bypass the finger print. I don\\'t know if I should order another one of these phones, I am pretty sure they are refurbished phones, but they avoid saying that in the description. Muy bonito, ligero, y fácil de usar. Pero no incluye la tarjeta microSD y creo de deberían de poner un manual de instrucciones y recomendaciones. It came without accessories Good The phone came on time! And is a perfect phone! Excellent phone Phone was flawlessLooked brand new The phone was brand new and worked perfectly. Because of failing vision, I bought the Note 4 (my third Galaxy) primarily for its screen size and font size, and was surprised by the wealth of other features. For example, S-voice, which is like iPhone\\'s Siri,does so many tasks, like addressing a text message, providing for dictating the text, tapping on the text to bring up a keyboard screen, where you can manually correct, then dictate some more. This is just the tip of the iceberg about the Note 4. It suits me just fine and then some. Highly recommended. .battery not good full charged after 2 hr battery charge down to 10 % . I send the package back to Amazon via UPS at yesterday ( 2016 April 17) The phone keep freezing , Perfect Good It is good phone El teléfono llego con todo, audífonos, CD, mini-manual, cable de datos, cargador.En excelentes condiciones, (sin la funda) caja abierta pero sin problemas.Luego de un día el software se daño sin razón alguna, no se si tiene que ver con el proveedor o realicé alguna acción incorrecta. De resto hasta ahorita, excelente señal, 3g para movistar, movilnet en mi país (Venezuela) y manejabilidad buena. Lo compre a FGS TRADING. the screem was easy to crack and the touch screem stop working but was ok Love it. Great for fitness tracker, cell phone calls are clear and easy to make and receive, lots of functions. As advertised, easy to figure out. Lots of youtube video. Recommended seller. I bought this phone because my Moto G 3rd generation started messing up once it updated to Marshmallow 6.0. There was no way I could downgrade to Lollipop, so I began searching for a new phone. Ive had Blu phones before and I love them. I just hate the low variety of phone cases. But anyways, this phone is amazing! My only issue I can say is I can\\'t se all the new emojis due to it only being lollipop. But that\\'s very minute. The camera is great, storage is great, and it runs smooth and fast. What shocked me the most is the camera. The back camera produces very quality professional photos. The front facing camera isn\\'t bad either. Get in some good light and those pics look great as well! The design of the phone is so stylish. I just love it. Great phone, verry satisfied Has to be the worst product I have purchased from Amazon! The ease of texting is amazing!!! Although, the phone doesn\\'t hold a charge for as long as it should and the numbers of dropped calls are ridiculous! I don\\'t use the phone much for calls and yet it needs to be charged daily..... had I known, I wouldn\\'t have purchased. I have never had this bad of an experience with any so-called new phone before. Wouldn\\'t recommend it to anyone! Very disappointed... I use amazon frequently and this purchase has totally turned me off! Can do everything and more that I expected. Htc are only phones I\\'ve decided to use . And I haven\\'t been disappointed with any that I\\'ve had. I loved this phone. I recently upgraded to a HTC my Touch 4G but I miss my Exhibit. This phone is so dependable. I have thrown this phone several times and it has been dropped more times than I can count. It has also been dropped in water ( I mean literaly submerged) in the tub and NOTHING on that phone quit working. This was my first Droid phone and I would recommend it to anyone. My co worker had a LG and when it was dropped in water her camera quit working, but on the Exhibit, no issues. The only complaint is that T-Mobile needs a little better coverage but other than that, I loved the phone it\\'s self. It was so easy to use that my 5 year old daughter had her on app page and could change the settings herself to adjust to her games. Excellent phone I bought this phone for my nephew and he is really happy with it, is a cheap phone and works really well the Canada is 5 mp but it\\'s ok. nice exellet Been using this phone for a couple of weeks and so far it works great. I wish it had more usable storage than 2 gigabyte, large apps use it up quick but, with a 32 gig memory card you have more than enough space for your pictures and files. I had a little bit of trouble finding a carry case for it but with a little work I located one here on Amazon. I get great reception with this phone and all of the features work well. I plan on purchasing a second one for my wife soon. This phone is the ultimate. It does everything and does it well, Easy to learn and manage, great size to replace my tablet in a pinch, Very good I have been looking forward to this phone since I knew my contract was going to be up soon.I got what I ordered! :) I had this phone for a few weeks now and its worth every penny. Just love it this phone is expendsive n outraglly retarted, it is slow, u dont get phone calls if ur on the internet, or even checking fb... great phone, but I did my research and bought the 900F for the 4G LTE capabilities and I have metropcs services and it turns out that it will only run on 3G H+..it cannot work on 4G, I am disappointed because I really wanted this phone..i love it, but it will not work on 4G. Amazing, battery longs FOR EVER.. I have serious concerns about the non standard android interface. Well... IS BETTER THAN NAKED ANDROID FOLKS... and I Loved the aspect , the screen, the digital fingerprint id access... At first it seemed like a great purchase. But I soon realized this phone has a lot of kinks. Apps, webpages, or even the pictures folder are slow to open, and sometimes require a phone restart before they work again. This can cause a lot of problems when trying to use the Uber app or quickly snap a pic of a moment. There are some weird bugs like the keyboard appearing or disappearing when it shouldn\\'t. I don\\'t recommend this phone, but I already paid for it, so I guess I\\'ll try to get some mileage out of it before getting a new one. The one great thing about this phone is the battery life (only about 30-40% loss per day). My service carrier is T-mobile. Work fine to me, and that\\'s saying a lot. TRUST ME It would not download pictures from text messages and would not work with my vans Uconnect wireless phone system. Am returning it. I use this phone mostly at work. It\\'s very small and dose not take up a lot of space. I have a lot of equipment on my person as a security guard in a hospital.I can honest day that I some time forget I have it in my front shir pocket. So far so good. Great phone! I like the fact that Apple has allowed a little more freedom to customize. Phone would be awesome but unless you are a dealer or know how to unlock phones, you cant put it on any plans. This a great little phone for texting. too easy to get hot It\\'s. A great watch does what they say it will. But I worry about the clasp...I know it works now but when the holes in the band get worn , is there another type of band to replace this one?I wear my watch everyday I love this watch!! I just don\\'t want to lose it. excelentes Practical and specific for calls. Increíble! Gracias! I arrived in good condition responds well but I battery lasts less than 3 hours and button illumination menu seems that no light This case has held up really well. It is easy to get my phone in and out of yet it still protects it well. I\\'ve dropped my 6+ a few times and have not had any issue with damaging my phone with this case. I do use glass screen protectors, but the case has worked fantastically with and without them. Great case; a little heavy, but does the job right! Beautiful, functional and reliable smartphone. Has a decent battery life and impressive camera. Great phone does everything I need it and then some Good phone for the price. iphone se Love the phone, but it overheats quite a bit which can shut down apps. It doesn\\'t take long for it to cool down. Best camera on a phone I\\'ve ever owned without a doubt. Güzel ürün ama. Satıcı olumsuz ardarda iki telofon siparişi verdim biri geldi diğeri gelmedi This phone definitely exceeds my expectations excellent product quality 1 of the best phone Better then I expected!!! :-) I received the phone with the \"on\" button missing. I took it into the apple store and they said it was counterfeit and refused to fix it. I contacted the seller but they refused to do anything. good product Good I really love my phone everything works great. This phone is absolutely great. Easy setup, plenty fast, and it works with ALL major carriers; what else could you want? The phone itself is built well too; Gorilla Glass 3, metal trim, and extremely rugged and sturdy even without a phone case (but I would suggest one anyway). In terms of specs it\\'s actually pretty comparable to most current generation flagship phones as well (maybe 10-20% less specs). The battery lasts long and has the turbo charge feature, and the screen quality and sound quality are both stellar! But most of all the #1 thing about this phone that will really push it over the edge is the PRICE which is unbelievable!Now Amazon has a version of this phone that makes it more affordable in exchange for ads but for me I just couldn\\'t see how saving $50 was worth seeing ads for the entire life of the phone. This phone (Plus model) also has better specs than the Amazon one, has a quite a bit better camera, and has my favorite feature ever: a fingerprint scanner that not only secures your phone but wakes it too. I mean really this phone has just about everything you could want and then some, and apparently is water resistant (I haven\\'t tested and don\\'t intend to try). Ultimately if you\\'re looking for value on a phone and really can\\'t see yourself dumping $600-900 on a flagship phone then this is DEFINITELY the phone for you.The one thing I will say about this phone is it does seem to have the overheating problems everyone talks about. It\\'s not like dangerously hot or anything but it\\'s definitely warmer than most other phones; however, it only gets hot when it\\'s under severe load like recording video (for long periods), playing a hardware intensive game, or loading up all your apps from your old device. Despite these problems though it\\'s still well worth the money as you\\'re not going to find a phone with this much value without camping outside a store for 48 hours for Black Friday. No mobile hotspot I love the phone all-be-it it feels light cheaply made. I have service thru Boost & it would have been nice if they would have offered to \"unlock\" it so as to be able to use this phone with whatever cellphone service one has. Other than that it works GREAT!!! Phone came as it should have, everything was included: earbuds, charger, manual, all in original packaging. This is four stars because I know this phone was supposed to come with a Samsung fast charger, which I did get. But it is a ginormous two piece charger that is unnecessary. It\\'s twice as large as the one that was supposed to be included.Now the phone is a beast. After about a month my only complaints are that the phone does get unnecessarily warm even when not gaming and the battery life can last you about a day, which is fine considering the phone can charge from 25% to full in about an hour. Good cellphone, have been using it in Venezuela with no issues. Would buy again. The first LG Env3 I rec\\'d had problems with the speaker. Within 3 days I had a new one that works great. The customer service was great! They were very prompt and made it hassle free for me, they sent a prepaid package for my return that I just had to drop in my mailbox. It is nice to actually have a hassle free return and a company that responses quickly. I will certainly use them again. Within the first day one single black light went out which was fine in my opinion I just message the company. But they never got back to me which is poor customer service in my opinion but whatever.The actual operating system ran like a champ but the backlight it\\'s just getting worse and worse. Thankfully I just ended up getting a different phone anyway. Good for the money though. Though it\\'s only been 24 hours, I am super impressed by the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 4.7 inch smartphone (name is terrible though). This is a great time for affordable, mid-range, unlocked, no-contract smartphones. This phone slots in between the two models of the 3rd generation Moto G. Other than the RAM (1.5 GB vs 2 GB), it\\'s very similar in specs to the more expensive Moto G model but at the price of the less expensive Moto G model (for now). I bought the Alcatel instead of the Moto G because it has a smaller, sleeker design (4.7 inch vs 5.0 inch screen and half as thin) and terrific front-facing stereo speakers. The screen is sharp and the speakers are very loud! The Idol 4.7 looks similar to the old Google Nexus 4, which I owned, but slimmer and sleeker (and more plasticy). It\\'s a little smaller than an iPhone 6 despite having the same screen size, and about as thin. The Moto G has much more durable build and is waterproof, and I suspect, better support. Both the Alcatel and the Moto G make great backup or travel phones, and also starter smartphones for teens. They can also be very solid everyday phones for most consumers. As the wireless companies move away from contracts and subsidizing phones, I wonder whether more folks will start moving to some of the mid-range phones. Many folks have been paying $600-800 every two years for new phones without really knowing it. Perhaps Apple will be safe with its high-end clientele--at least for now--but companies like Samsung are very vulnerable. These $200 phones are more than good enough for the typical user--with performance comparable to the flagship phones from two years ago. I worry a bit about durability given the materials it\\'s made out of. I should probably buy a case, but the phone is so sleek and attractive that I kind of don\\'t want to put one on. Five stars for the amazing value! The Quality to price ratio for this phone is terrific. Don\\'t let the somewhat pedestrian tech specs fool you - the Blu Vivo 5 (also known as the Gionee Elife S6 in some countries) is an outstanding phone. This review will be a quick overview more than a detailed analysis of what makes this phone great, but I hope I can help some of you who might not be sure whether they should take the plunge.The Pros: The Vivo 5 has 3GB of RAM, the standard for flagship phones of last year, and rather relaxed memory management. This makes for a phone that often holds onto apps long after you need them, and it\\'s much better about this than, for example, the Samsung Galaxy S6. This is almost unprecedented for a phone at this price point and is a standout feature of this phone. If you\\'re a heavy multitasker, this phone will give you no trouble.Also impressive is the screen. At 720p and 5.5 inches, it\\'s actually pretty low resolution compared to other phones, even in the same price group (the Asus Zenfone 2, Huawei Honor 5X, and Alcatel Idol 3, for example). But it\\'s a panel that, in every other respect, is comparable to the AMOLED screens of the Samsung Galaxy S6 or Huawei Nexus 6P. Its colors are pretty and saturated, video looks great, and games are gorgeous. I can\\'t get over the fact that this is a $200 phone with such a pretty display - it\\'s about on par with the 1080p panel on the Alcatel Idol 3, which has one of the best IPS LCDs I\\'ve ever seen on a phone. But I digress.The phone is appreciably speedy, handling most animations through home screens and the UI in general with ease. Most games will run fine at worst - but in general they run extremely well. Don\\'t expect incredible benchmark scores - it scores 10000 less in AnTuTu than the LG G3 (the T-Mobile branded D851, if it matters) it replaced for me. But in day to day usage, it is a lot more smooth and fluid than my G3 was.The metal build feels great and unlike a lot of other metal phones doesn\\'t seem to get too hot under normal use or even benchmarking.The buttons are clicky and easy to tell apart. With the included case the metal feel is lost but the plastic seems high quality and it\\'s not slippery on the back, a problem some cases can have.Battery life is outstanding. I can last roughly a day and a half between recharges with moderate use. I figure it has plenty to do with the mix of a power-sipping upper midrange MediaTek SoC and 720p display.Rear camera performance is pretty good (not mind-blowing) in most lighting conditions, though lower light isn\\'t quite as good. The front camera is a bit noisy indoors but is plenty acceptable in most other conditions.Wi-Fi speeds are phenomenal and better than what you can generally expect with a comparable Qualcomm chip. LTE speeds aren\\'t as good, but they\\'re fine for what you\\'d generally use for LTE and due to the screen any video apps will top out at 720p anyways.The Cons: There are some bad points about the Vivo 5, though, and I\\'d be remiss if I didn\\'t mention them. The Vivo 5\\'s cheaper cousin, the Vivo XL, has a much wider range of LTE bands, as does the Life One X. Depending on where you live, this may be important, since some AT&T and T-Mobile bands alike aren\\'t represented on the Vivo 5.The Vivo 5 lacks on screen buttons, meaning in applications that support immersive mode, you might accidentally hit the capacitive buttons. I would\\'ve loved to see a software toggle to turn off the back and overview buttons while in a game, like recent Samsung phones offer.The Vivo 5 also launches with a Android 5.1 Lollipop, which is a version old by now. Not only that, it\\'s a version with extremely heavy customizations. While some are nice, such as the Android 6.0-style permissions management, others, like the notification management and lack of app drawer on the stock launcher, are sometimes frustrating. Along with some features of stock Lollipop missing, such as Smart Lock, it makes for a poor user experience in many ways.The display panel is only 720p at 5.5\", and if you\\'re paying attention it can be noticeable. There\\'s thankfully not much in the way of screen door effect like some lower-ppi displays, but individual pixels are far from invisible.The nearly flat back on such a huge phone makes it a bit difficult to hold, though the metal is not too slippery and the included case even less so.The audio quality from the internal speakers and included earbuds is fine, as is audio output from Bluetooth. However, when tested with my Sony MDR-7506 headphones, there was audible crackling noise. Actually, \"audible\" is probably not the right word. The noise is downright loud and can be heard easily even while you\\'re listening to something. This is certainly not an audiophile\\'s phone and it\\'s clear that audio was one of the corners cut with the Vivo 5.The included case nullifies a lot of the ergonomics of the buttons. They\\'re still clicky, but harder to tell apart. It also prevents most headphones from plugging into the jack all the way, reducing sound quality even more than the Vivo 5 already does. Even the included earbuds don\\'t seem to go in all the way with the case on, but audio quality is good enough with them.The capacitive buttons on the front of the phone lack a backlight. On my silver and white model, at least, this means the buttons are virtually invisible in certain lighting conditions.There is no fingerprint reader, while the identically priced Honor 5X does have one.Overall, despite the Vivo 5\\'s shortcomings, I can\\'t recommend it more unless you need good audio quality through the headphone jack or live in an area outside of the Vivo 5\\'s LTE bands. It\\'s a fantastic phone, especially for the price.Addendum and additional recommendations: Blu does sell a few other phones with the same chipset if you\\'re not totally sold on the Vivo 5. If you\\'re in an area with limited LTE, I would advise getting the cheaper Vivo XL, which, despite its lower storage, lower RAM, and plastic build, is virtually identical in every other specification (including that gorgeous AMOLED screen) and actually supports more LTE bands, including T-Mobile\\'s band 12. It also has a user-replaceable battery, if that\\'s important to you. The Blu Life One X is another solid option for people who need a slightly smaller phone. It has a 1080p IPS display, stock Android, and virtually identical specifications to the Vivo XL otherwise including the LTE bands. I haven\\'t used either of these phones, though, so your mileage may vary.UPDATE (6 May 2016): The MT6753T chip in the Vivo 5 has SHA1 and SHA2 support according to AIDA64, so I encrypted the phone\\'s internal storage. Performance is virtually identical to before, but there are a few situations where the phone can end up getting hot - mostly stuff that makes practically any phone run hot. For example, charging and doing anything really taxing, like playback of 720p video, benchmarking, or heavy gaming will make the phone so warm as to be uncomfortable if the storage is encrypted and it wasn\\'t something I noticed before I did encrypt it. That said, if the phone isn\\'t charging, it still doesn\\'t get very warm.Just so you know: With this 6 May update, I made a few tweaks for accuracy and grammar mistakes I had made in a previous version of this review, as well as trimming down a few unnecessary paragraphs. Phone did not work properly refund issued without issue i bought this phone as a gift for my grandson.i had to go to work that friday 13th but he and his friends took it to the local AT&T store and got it activated.he loves it! The ringer on my 4 year old Bold 9930 quit for good a few weeks ago. As an 8 year BB user and business person, I was loathe to get an Android phone - I need secure email and a physical keyboard since so much of my business is email based, as well as excellent phone quality. I had been hoping that the Classic launch would receive favorable reviews. By the time my Bold stopped functioning there were 112 reviews posted on Amazon and they were for the most part outstanding. I decided to switch to another provided who supports the Classic, and I purchased the phone. I have had the phone for a few weeks. It is the best phone I could possibly have ever dreamed of and I am still learning all of the functions.Two of my high powered clients saw the phone on separate occasions and were extremely impressed - they did not even know of it\\'s existence. My 23 year old niece flipped when she saw the phone. I can surely say that Blackberry needs some good PR and perhaps that along with this marvel hybrid will help to resurrect them, and deservedly so. Excellent product!!! EXELENTE Such a Bummer. The phone was marketed as Un-Locked. It an ATT box that said NEW- complete with Apple-Ear-buds etc.Had already decided to free myself from T-MOBILE- Went to Cricket. Store manager & his asst. tried to get this I-PHONE to work- multiple Micro SIm cards etc. Result- store owner said something is WRONG with the phone. So I figure on a total of Six hours Wasted. I Guess- U Get What U Pay For. I really wanted an I-Phone- but no way can I afford the New Model. I received this item along with other items I ordered the same day. I\\'m looking forward to seeing if this phone will be better than my last phone. So far, so good. Thank you, and keep up the great work! Have been using this phone for two weeks now. I absolutely love it. Sound quality is great, battery life is good. The pics look great! So happy I bought this phone. I did a lot of research before purchasing. Great price for phone! Would highly recommend! 😁 To all those wondering, this phone will work with straight talk, T-Mobile, cricket, or any GSM network. It is not compatible with CDMA networks like Verizon and sprint. I\\'m using it with straight talk. I just put my sim card in and it was ready to go. This phone is a terrific buy! I have owned one for about a year now and I love it. I just replaced my son\\'s damaged Samsung with the Burst! He thinks it is a great phone. You can\\'t beat the price and all the features. excelent I purchased this phone for my boyfriend for Christmas. A week later it offers a update and so he does and bam, phone no longer boot up. He has been without a phone since this bad update and still have not heard from customer service on how to fix it. Looks like everyone who has this phone and tried the update is having the same problem. I have never written a bad review. Thank you Blu for being my first! The phone is all in Russian and appears refurbished and not factory new. I managed to change the language but it had a number saved in its contacts which says a lot. Besides that, a big problem is that the phone will only charge if plugged to the european charger with european prongs it came with or if plugged directly to the computer. This is NOT OK! No scratches, works 100 %, new , perfect cellphone. I purchased this cover through amazon. The price was really good. Inner cover and outer cover. Screen protector attached to the top section of the inner cover. No bubbles to worry about like the stick on plastic type. Belt clip included. I have had it a few days now. The cover does its job. I recommend it. OtterBox makes a car mount to attach the phone with this case. The last Steve Jobs design. I love this format. It\\'s still a Phone. I don\\'t want a tablet on my ear. Coming from a 5s, Don\\'t see much diffrence. I was a bit scepticle about the phone being unlocked but I must say it is 400% unlocked. I don\\'t live in an area with at&t n those kind of big time companies I live in the Caribbean with local phone companies and it works perfectly . I\\'m very very very happy with my purchase. Bought from seller raydes he is amazing excellent Everithing like it says on the descrption. Perfect phone and accesories. Works perfect in Argentina!Buy it now. Real deal Good job, good service, good product. Product of very good quality. VERY GOOD The product came to me very quickly, and in great condition. However I had to return it because I did not have the proper Sim card size. If you have a smaller Android phone, realize in order to use this product you need to upgrade your card, or also buy a simcard adapter (but this can be risky as some of them can mess up your phone). This watch met all my expectations Got it for the wifey.Decent performance, nice screen, comes with accessories like case, screen protector, headphones. She likes it as well. It is smooth and quick. Large screen, easy to use. I got a Sim card to ensure the phone would stay quick. Very pleased with my purchase. Excelente I love the phone. It serves my purpose generally. It has some very good features that I need in a phone. I do not want to give it up. However, I am unable to charge the battery. I still have my Blackberry Bold and luckily the batteries are the same so I can use it to charge my battery. what should I do? my favorite phone ever. Batter life is decent, a couple days on average with lots of use. Sounds is crisp and clear, good for both conversation and music. Camera is better than some non-phone cameras. Very convenient keyboard while maintaining small pocket size. I can\\'t wait for Sony to update it.. Love it When you make a review its important to consider what you are getting at the price you have paid. I can\\'t understand why people make fuss about the things that are not paid for. This phone is brilliant at this price. You simply cannot ask for more. And now with the Lollipop update, you\\'ve already got way moreOne suggestion - Try lowering the top of the phone by a few cms in a way to ensure the top of the phone hits the center of your ear while talking. The sound was perfectly ok to hear in that position. The phones arrived on the first day of the promised time frame. Sent the unlocked phones to India for family over there and they are very satisfied and the phones work great!!! Love this design and it is perfect for protecting my iPhone. Good ProductArrive on time Great deal! Decent quality phone for the price. This phone lacks a few things that my s5 has, but it makes up for lack of hardware with great Sony software. Got one. Wow! The Kata V4 is easy to use and simple to setup. I have 2 providers, AT&T and T Mobile. I put both sim cards since V4 supports dual SIM 3G comes up AT&T and T Mobile works perfect. The screen is 4.5” and memory is 8GB. I use it for traveling and on the go. I’m not afraid of losing it makes me much happier. The hotspot app is very unique. It’s the easiest way to share data. I’m surprised why LG, Samsung and even iPhone don’t have something like Kata’s hotspot app. The hand feel and grip are very nice. For this price, I really really love this phone and its design. Fantastic! excelente Delivered on time.. Items was exactly as Described. The cellphone did not work. The scream was damaged. It looked like used Bought on Feb 15 and the charger cable is already not working. Can\\'t find a manufacturer replacement charger cable. Still a great phone but useless if it can\\'t charge. The phone arrived on time and was working, however, the item is posted as used very good bu the phone came with many scratches/ small dings on the back of the phone on the colored part. I have t admit the screen was perfect without a scratch so that was great. I gave it a lower rating because it made me believe it would be good as new with maybe one scratch. Also, there is no sim card in the phone so you can\\'t activate it until you go to the store and sometimes it may take some pushing to get the employees at the store to give you the card because they don\\'t get commission on the small card. I would recommend this to anyone. I got the white iPhone 5 and it\\'s amazing for a certified refurbished phone. I don\\'t usually write reviews but this product is so good I had to Excellent UPDATE: I failed to notice the part in the manual that says this phone typically needs a new battery annually. I also found the APN settings online when I got this phone for my husband. He went to a different AT&T store to get the password, and the guy there was not able to help. It\\'s nice to look like a genius to your spouse once in a while:Name: ATTAPN: wap.cingularProxy: <Leave in Blank>Port: <Leave in Blank>Username: wap@cingulargprs.comPassword: cingular1Server: <Leave in Blank>MMSC: http://mmsc.cingular.comMMS proxy: wireless.cingular.comMMS port: 80MCC: 310MNC: 410Authentication type: <Leave in Blank>APN type: default,supl,mmsAPN Protocol: Leave it to the Default oneJUNE 2015: So far, we haven\\'t had any problems, just a couple of wrinkles. The sound and camera work great, the touch screen is responsive, and we downloaded recorded videos to our computer with the USB cable easily (once we figured it out). The user manual leaves a lot to be desired in terms of detailed instructions, but most of our questions were answered online anyway. There was a light-duty cover that came with the phone, but I had already gotten the heavier one recommended on Amazon. I\\'ve dropped the phone a couple of times with no damage occurring. As to the wrinkles....I couldn\\'t text pictures until I went into the AT&T store, and they plugged in their password under the access point names setting. Then it was fine. I also noticed that using data is like a power-vacuum on the battery, it\\'s dead in a couple of hours. But I don\\'t use it often (only while traveling), and I try to limit/disable the apps to preserve the battery life. Talk and text alone will allow the battery to last 2 days in my experience. For my needs, it\\'s like I just got $500 in my pocket by choosing this phone. excellent good product , I recommend this seller 100 % Thanks to Amazon I got my money back. The home would overheat to the point of shutting down for no apparent reason other than being boiling hot This is the worse phone everyday, it freezes and the tabs will stuck on a letter. Don\\'t buy it. Excellent cellphone! Excellent service Nice phone. It arrived broken I didn\\'t hear the voice of income calls and I can\\'t repair or return because was a gift for other people which returned to me late It is a peice of junk it run out of battery and i charge it and did nit work anymore i need to return it Hi all,I am writing at the following: last 18-01-2015 I bought a LG G2 Mini phone. What is my surprise the phone is not working properly the application message. I can\\'t send and receive message, show the following mistake \"Unfortunately the application will close\", Further to this, the main camera shows the same error \"Unfortunately the application will close\". Browsing this error in internet forums I find that is a problem of android 4.4.2 system.In this case that I can make this phone cost $ 205 and I can not find the way to work properly in internet forums mention that I debeo change the systema 4.4.2 on the other. But is an original new phone, Why I have to install a modified version to fix this problem?, these applications are basic in android system send and receive message and take pictures those which can not be performed.waiting for your comments about it.regardsLuis Serrano I am very disappointed at how it turned out to work. It is a nice phone, personally i think it was over priced but i bought it anyway. It worked okay for just a week; brand spanking new phone so i am not sure how this can happen. it heats up for no reason, freezes up where you cant even turn it off. it goes off by itself after a couple of hours and it comes back up when ever it feels like it. i am miss some very important phone calls due to that. I keep all my meetings and POC and locations of them on my phone so when it started acting like that, it made my daily schedule very difficult to tract and manage sometimes. i need it change. I was looking for an upgrade phone from my iphone 4 and wanted to go back to an android phone. I use prepaid no contract service by Straight Talk. I wanted a phone that was going to be heavy on my pockets. I was searching on Amazon for phones when the Blu Studio phones came up. I have never heard of Blu Studio so I was curious. I had read several reviews from customers and was please the majority of the reviews I read were very favorable. I decided to buy the Blue Studio 5.0 HD in pink. I have had it now for about two weeks and I love it. Setting up the phone was easy. I just popped my slim card in from my iphone and I was up and running. I love the large screen, great volume, excellent picture taking and 4G speed. I have no complaints. My 19 year old daughter was also in the market for a new phone and recommended the Blu Studio 5.0 HD and she loves it. She said she couldn\\'t be happier and we both love the affordable cost. We are so glad we didn\\'t spend a lot of money on one of the other top cellphones on the market. I will definitely buy a another Blu Studio in the future when I\\'m ready four another upgrade again. I would like to try the Blu Windows phones it looks like a good phone. Excellent.... Great device Minor wear, looks brand new. Months after purchase I have had no problems at all with the phone. The Phone came in perfect condition. i\\'m satisfied Is a very goog product nice Case broke within 2 weeks. Great if youre not going to open it a lot. Good Didn\\'t care for this. Hard to setup with AT&T...at least in my area. BLUF: Phone is as promised and strongly recommend if it has what you need. No learning curve on using it.I ordered one of these for my daughter originally and she fell in love with it and so did her friends. She originally wanted a Iphone, but I didn\\'t want to switch carriers an didn\\'t want to risk a getting one for her that someone unlocked as we don\\'t live in the same area... Now this is in no way like the Iphone, but it does all she really wanted, text, internet (infrequently) and most of all a touch screen with a qwerty keypad. She love the phone so much that I played with it and fell in love with it myself! My work has Tmobile and is very cheap with getting us the actual phone, for that mater I have had the same work phone for over 6 years! Not only was the battery for my work phone bad, I could not find a replacement battery as it was so old. So I bought one of these Cookie unlocked phones and I like it almost as much as my personal Nokia smartphone that I paid twice as much for! Phone is very user friendly, except for setting up some of the features such as internet, but once that is done you\\'re done. So far I have had no trouble with either of the two phones and so far have exceeded my (and my daughters) expectation. Love this case, I wanted purple and got it, fits my phone great! updated from Nexus 5 to this and love it. the screen size is perfect. not to big, not to small. fits in hand well. the bottons on back seem weired at first, but I live a lot now, after month of use. camera is great. the phone works great on Straight talk service. I like the build in wireless charging option. I use the same charger as I did on N5. it shipped with KitKat, but with in min of wifi connection, it updated to Lollipop. As far as phones go it is pretty nice easy to use .. However buyer beware it is considered a smartphone and requires a data package.. not just a texting one.. the sprint people at first told my daughter it didn\\'t but they changed my plan to data so upon deeper investigation I found out that it was in fact a smartphone.. so as far as phones go it is a great buy for the money but only if you want a full data package. I was really surprised because it is not only good, but it is really excelent. It easily compares to the iphones two of my sons have and the samsungs my grandchildren have. Item received was not exactly as advertised, thankfully the Seller promptly refunded my money upon return. Crap. The phone we received couldn\\'t be activated because Verizon showed it was already activated by someone else. Had to return it for a refund. Received it today It is simple and seems good enough as a backup phone I\\'ll post in a couple of years to see how it withstood the power of time!Update #1: one week after purchase, the phone has a pretty bad sound quality people hear me badly and I hear them badly also, this is only a backup phone and only costs 20 bucks but if call quality is the most important aspect on a backup phone for you you should look elsewhere. The battery life is insane though and that\\'s mainly what I wanted so I\\'m not docking any more stars. Overall a good phone for the price. There is no way to get rid of unwanted menu icons and the phone call quality is not what I expect from Nokia but the phone is durable. My daughter loved it. Great Christmas present. Great! Have had posh microx for a day now. It is not going to replace your full size android phone. No app drawer, cannot uninstall some apps. No weather widget available except native, closest city 50miles away. That being said, amazing for the 30$ I paid. I have lots of smartphones. Doesn\\'t compare with my note or fire phone. Would say it is about as good as my Alcatel c1. Other than the pros or cons of being super small. I would say its a solid low end android phone. My phone was not factory unlocked! Incredible performance for price, on par with phones costing $100\\'s more. Use it everyday for work- emails, photo docs, scanning, emailing docs back to office, just a beast, a workhorse. Octa-core performance never lets me down, no overheating. Call quality & sound awesome for price point. Was looking at S6 also at the time, but decided to save my money & go with ZTE. I\\'m completely satisfied Gave this smartphone to my father for his birthday. It meet all his expectations and even pull out some surprises for him. I can even dare to say that, for a tech junkie, it can pull the trick pretty well. I never has an Android phone and was pretty much horrified to switch from my iPhone... Well, I will never go back to iPhone or any other phone for that matter. Blu Vivo5 had the most beautiful packaging and it\\'s an incredible phone all around. I am using it now for a few months and have not had one issue, it\\'s super fast and of an excellent quality... all that for 200$. Very happy customer, thank you. :) Amazing Phone. A month ago I bought 5 Posh Titan HD E550a for me and my family. I can say that five phones are working great. It works fast, the camera is nice, and it has a very good memory. I am very happy with my purchase, and all i can do is recommend and give five stars to this phone. this phone is beyond expectation. I am enjoying the phone tremenduously. i have already bought another one for my brother in Africa. I\\'m hoping it\\'s going to work well for him as it is working for me. the phone speed is superb. I can recommend this phone to my friends. in my opinion it beat iphone any time, lots of free downloads and many more good stuffs. I am not a tech person but I know any tech will enjoy this phone like any other expensive phones. Skeptical but did my research.... All I can say is WOW! Just like my Galaxy Note 2 but without the pen & bigger. Battery lasts for 2.5 days. FYI: Transfer your contacts via bluetooth. Feel like I have an iPad Mini in my hand. LOVE IT!!! Battery is non-removeable but replaceable by company! I plugged my Sim ATT card in & BAM, I\\'m in business. Huawei promises a Lollipop upgrade... We\\'ll see! Either way, I\\'m very pleased! My 64gb SD card I bought did NOT work. Excelent This phone was not unlocked. I bought this phone because I didn\\'t feel like paying $800 for a \"high end\" phone that pretty much does the same thing as this phone does. It does everything I need it to do and it has 64gb of internal memory which is plenty for all of my 30 apps that I install and for my pictures. It comes stock with Android 6.x which is all I need really. I\\'m also pretty happy with the battery life though I wish the charging was a little faster. One of my favorite things about the phone is the lack of bloatware, which I have been use to being a Samsung customer for the past 4 years. I\\'ve never had a problem with the fingerprint scanner and it works pretty flawlessly. The only slight problem that I have with the phone is that once in a while, it freezes up. Not sure why but it usually takes a couple of minutes to unfreeze. Aside from that, this is an amazing phone and I\\'m glad it\\'s available for this price. Bonus: It comes with a headphone jack and it won\\'t explode on you. Excellent well i don\\'t have the phone yet but right now ill give it a 5star! I hope it was worth my money update 4/3/16 phone works perfectly for to update... 9/27/16 the screen is very lose pops in and out with the slightest drop. Dropping the score 3star I had some problems with the battery charging and also dying way before 1%. Sent it back, battery was replaced. It still acts a little strange with the battery life at times and just connecting to charger. it doesn\\'t connect right away. have to plug and un-plug from phone jack/wall etc. until it connects. over night, I got a line going through half of my screen. Top is normal and bottom is darker. Not sure how that happened while sleeping. I have had the phone in an Otterbox since day one. Never had any issues like this with a Iphone before. Battery charge gets worse and worse. don\\'t recommend. Paid $800 only to get a fake iPhone!First of all, the charging animation is not Apple\\'s at all. Second, the silence button is crooked. Third, the phone was used from when I opened the box, even forgetting the fact this is not an iPhone. You can obviously tell as well this iPhone is fake: I mean, look at the grammar. Apple or any company wouldn\\'t do anything like this, and this doesn\\'t look like stock iOS. The reason I got this case is the storage compartment. It works as described. Wife loves it! The add said it was unlocked And the fact is that I still had to pay extra to someone else to really unlock it and be able to use it This phone is marred by unacceptable Bluetooth performance. It literally drops my Bluetooth headset when I put it in my pants pocket! On the plus side, the sound and speaker phone functionality is quite good, as other reviewers have mentioned. It also is not an exceptionally rugged phone as the screen broke after a fall from less than 3 feet. I bought this product, but this don\\'t carry a memory card. And I read has 8 Gb of memory internal. Nothing except the low light camera needs improvement. This is a beast of a device.On top of that, ZTE had been providing monthly updates so far... That\\'s better than some of the mainstream flagships! excelent Great It\\'s an absolute steal at this price for how feature rich this phone is. Favorably compares to $400-500 devices. The phone is really amazing. It is fast and has it all as it was shown on apple event. I\\'m very very satisfied with my iPhone 7. Awesome job!!!! I will be doing more business here!!!!!! Worked no problem.. But the notifications came through blank, txt and phone calls worked perfect.. Battery lasted all day. Just keep in mind this is the first generation and can use some updating.. That is the reason I returned this item.. NOT TOO BAD A PRODUCT. After about a decade, again, it was time for a new replacement phone.Oddly, the one received was weird in many regards, e.g., Motorola was displaying upside down...A quick call later and instantly the problem was resolved, e.g., customer service credited me back for the purchase and, to my surprise, said to throw away the phone rather than ship it back to them.I am still impressed with how thorough and expeditious the customer service was!Instead of leaving me with a bad impression, even now, months later, I am still smiling at the memory of the great customer service received! It worked for a week then it started saying no service i bought a new sim card and it did the same so i got rid of it Fine Excellent seller will buy again. It is perfect this phone . First time that I bought a phone online and I had a very good experience . It\\'s in very good condition and I got the phone next day . The only thing it\\'s that on the back doesn\\'t say \"galaxy s7 edge\" A fantastic battery life. Read on reviews about this, but until I actually purchased and saw for myself, had trouble believing. A 1 starrer..!! This is why -1. First, and most important - the phone would turn off every now and then without any apparent reason! This is a horrible thing to happen as I would suddenly discover that my phone is turned off, and I am not sure for how long it has been off and how many calls I have missed! And that\\'s not all; here comes the even worse part - Most of the times you cannot restart the phone without first plugging in to it\\'s charger (even though it is fully charged)!! Now if you are outside, or do not have the charger with you, just pretend you belong to the pre-cell-phone era till you get back home! Grrrr....2. The in-built GPS never worked. It will keep trying locate you and finally fail! That means all those funky apps which use GPS data are not for you!3. Thought updating the firmware might help resolve the issues. Tried doing that and surprise - it failed! It gave me a message that this phone is not eligible for firmware update!! Great!4. Tried to live with this \"phone\" for about a month after which I gave up and decided to return it. Then comes the final surprise! I tried to \\'Factory-Reset\\' the phone, and that failed too!! I tried several times in many different ways, but with same result - it was unable to factory reset itself. Obviously I could not return the phone without factory resetting it as it had my google account configured in it and there was no way to remove it without factory resetting it.So there it lies, at the corner of my room, gathering dust, while my $140 is enjoying in somebody else\\'s pocket!! Love it I got this watch on Amazon about 3 or four months ago be Aust I thought it was simpler to the Apple Watch... BUT BOY WAS I WRONG!!!!!, Instead save your almost $30 and buy the MTK2502C it\\'s a fake version of the Apple Watch, it\\'s water proof, Has a heart rate sensor and looks exactly the same as the Apple Watch and its only $74 Almost brand new, it has a really small bump easy to miss. Great phone, complete with cables, deliver on time. Thanks! This \"smart\" watch is not worth the money. Not only do the functions not work properly, the app needed to connect with my iPhone does not work. The built in app scan failed out, and since the instructions were lacking, I had to search for similar apps, all of which did nothing!Luckily, this was bought for a 9-year old to see if she could be responsible enough for a smart watch. Within 24 hours, she accidentally submerged it in water and gave it a quick death. Such a waste of money. Firstly:When i began unpacked, box don\\'t looked like new.Secondly:Why this cell phone doesn\\'t have OTA update? I entered to menu about phone, and what i saw? No update center. This cell phone must had this option. I tried update to lollipop and i didn\\'t. Also tried used PC suite and i got the same, plus error message.Thirdly:Battery is very sucks. 5 or 6 hours and cell phone just gonna die.Fourthly:Screen, when i touched screen they had some defect. After a lifetime of Samsung, HTC and LG smartphones, I decided to take a chance on the ZTE Axon - my first unlocked device and first ZTE phone. I am using it on AT&T\\'s network. After reading forums, product reviews and doing comparisons, I jumped in to see what the hype was about.Let me start by saying this thing is smoking fast - it has a Snapdragon 810 chip set with 4 GB RAM, which means that flipping through screens, watching movies, playing with the camera/video and even gaming has been great. This is more memory than I had in my last device (LG G3) and it shows. I have not yet had a hang, stutter or anything. One reviewer mentioned the phone heating up. I personally have not experienced this in my usage and I have been throwing a lot of stuff at it. This thing is fast!I got the pfthalo blue color with gold trim and it is stunning. I receive comments on it regularly as it looks unlike most other boring black devices out there. The phone is metal and feels very solid - hard to believe that I paid what I did for it. It has a mono speaker but the volume is loud and sound is clear. I would have preferred stereo speakers but have used this for conference calls on speakerphone and it hasn\\'t caused an issue yet. I get the impression that ZTE put a ton of effort into the Axon and it does indeed feel like a flagship offering with lots of attention paid to details, textures, components, etc. Just what I am looking for in a cool device that I want to use every day and feel good doing it.As a few other reviewers have noted, the camera on the Axon is excellent. It gives me great options like slow motion, multi-exposure, panorama, HDR, time lapse and more along with a bevy of manual f stop and camera controls if I want to tweak it to my experience. I can even adjust the depth of field AFTER my photo is taken, something that gives me a great look if I forget to adjust ahead of time. I did not notice any aberrations or color issues when I transferred them to my computer and blew them up. Video is sharp and fluid as well.It may sound trite, but the screen is just flat-out gorgeous. Great contrast, viewing angle, etc. - what everyone should be looking for. Colors were bright and accurate and everything I did on it looked great, from Netflix to web to games. Seriously, I am impressed with this screen. My wife\\'s Samsung showed colors brighter but they were almost unnatural to a degree because of the OLED screen. I prefer realism, just as I intended when I take photos or watch movies.My Axon Pro came with 32GB memory but no microSD slot. At first I thought this may be an issue, but the more I thought about it, it\\'s easiest just to back things up to the cloud or on my computer and when I looked at all the photos and music I already had loaded onto the phone, I still had tons of room left. So this is not an issue for me.I\\'ll end by saying this has changed my entire outlook on ZTE as a company. I used to think of them for prepaid low-end phones over the years but the Axon changes everything. I have recommended this phone to family members and friends and I remind them that it does virtually everything their more expensive phones do but at a fraction of a price. I paid only $450 for all of this!Sorry, Samsung, I am done paying $800 (or more) for a phone - never again. Well done, ZTE! You\\'ve gained a new fan. It is a very user friendly phone my husband, who is not tech savvy at all, can really get along with. Excellent Just as described. Due to my mistake, I had to send it back. I ordered the Iphone 6. Best value I could find. Great customer support. Wonderful to work with. Excellent phone, exceeded all my expections. One of the main concerns I had while buying this phone was the battery. But to my surprise it is lasting upto 3 days. Awesome display and camera. This is the best phone I ever had. The Xperia ZL is a great piece of technology. Fast processor, excellent HD screen, reasonable battery life.Alas, for reasons unclear to me at present, the phone died within 60 days of purchase.When I say \"died\", please allow me to be more specific. I\\'m fairly tech-savvy, and do not remotely give up at the first sign of trouble. Alas, this phone beat me.Seemingly at random one afternoon, the phone\\'s touch-screen stopped responding to input. So...that pretty much means the phone is, for all intents and purposes...dead. I attempted the following basic solutions:1) Factory Reset2) \"Repair\" option on the Sony Bridge / desktop app3) Reinstall OS / Flash OSUnfortunately, none of these worked. The phone, even after reinstalling the drivers and firmware, continue to be unresponsive on the touch-screen.I spoke to Sony\\'s warranty department. And unfortunately, since I\\'m in Europe at the moment where the specific LTE model is not sold...I\\'m basically out of luck. No suggestions from Sony, other than to ship it back to a regional repair site in North America.So in the end...I spend a good $600 or so...on a phone that functioned...for about 60 days.Unfortunately, Sony\\'s entire Z-line of products seems to be plagues with several \"instant death\" problems. Unfortunately what I experienced is not uncommon. Just dig around google a bit; you\\'ll see.So...if you\\'d like to pay $10/day for a phone on average...that will become a brick within 60 days...well, look no further. Charger did not work, had to purchase this as a local supplier, but phone works well. Great phone but the battery pack was faulty and I had to purchase a new phone. I love the durability I just wish the product wasn\\'t messed up. I have no problems with it so far. I\\'ve been using it intensely. I\\'m going from app to app and there\\'s no performance loss at all. It\\'s got ample of RAM. I never ran out of RAM yet. It\\'s always somewhere from 2GB to 500MB free. The GPS is lightning quick. When I need it I just turn it on and I use Google Maps or Waze and my location is already pinpointed. The battery is not bad at all. On a typical day of reading news, checking emails, updating apps, watching youtube, playing games, and texting/calling, I end the day around 20% - 30%. If you get a case with a screen cover with a circle cutout, you get to use utilities like a flashlight, camera, a clock, a calendar, and checking the weather right from the circle cutout, which I use a lot to check time and to use the flashlight. And finally, it comes pre-installed with a bunch of utilities like a power management app that allows me to set a time where I can switch the phone to power save mode, which saves battery. I set it from 11PM to 6AM while I sleep. I\\'m not that kind of person who charges their phone at night because I don\\'t really need to. It comes with a fast charger and it takes about 30 - 45 minutes to fully charge then I go to work. Nice phone , a lot of phone for the money . Works great on Cricket . Just order yourself a Cricket starter kit her on Amazon for $10, plug in the sim and you are good to go . Be sure and get the Cricket app from the app store . would buy it again great price on the best case on the market. this is a replacement case for a black one i received when getting the phone. 1 1/2 years ago. that case is still working fine except the access piece that covers charging port broke off after several thousand opening and shutting to charge. This phone is just as described. Great value for money. Extremely happy with this purchase. Only one word describes it, awesome! I like Nice and neat product. I placed a T-Mobile Sim card and it started working nicely.. So far I am very happy with this phone. I hope will last longer than my last Samsung Captivate (lasted 2 months) before going crazy. (the phone of course).I am still configuring all the apps and haven\\'t tried 3G yet. I\\'ll post when done.When I plugged it in on my USB port, it inmediatly, through KIES, did an automatic software update and it was done perfectly.So far, very happy with this phone. it was broken so easily beautiful,fast and useful phone. The international version seems to have some issues connecting to T-Mobile LTE in the US. I get much lower speeds and less LTE connectivity with this phone than I did with my old Nexus 5. I have not tried to make many calls yet, but the normal cell reception also seems very weak (only one or two bars, where I think my Nexus would have 2-3 bars).I am going to try returning this one and picking up a US version, hopefully that fixes the problem.... Otherwise a pretty slick phone Huge phone!!! I like it. Happy with this purchase. thank you I am having issue with the browsing speed using my data. New. Works. What postpaid means, I have no idea. But for the money it\\'s a good replacement phone. Ordered my phone after looking at for a couple days,am very impressed by the quality of the phone, arrived on time and am loving it I think its better than an iPhone, it gives your more memory space. It has face recognition to unlock the phone. It also has features that an iPhone doesn\\'t have plus a big screen than an iPhone. Summary overall, i\\'m happy with it, except for slightly weak signal.I\\'ve had it over a year of rough use so far. A great deal for the price. (Note: looks like the price has increased since i bought it)- Worked fine when i inserted my ATT sim card with no extra tweaking.- Good battery life- Good camera (but it sucks in low light).- Good large screen (but not great in bright sunlight)- Browses web and plays video smoothly, Runs multiple apps with no glitches.- Battery cover feels flimsy, but this not noticeable once the include protective cover is on it. (but definitely NOT waterproof even with protective cover)- Sound quality even at max is a little quiet, both on calls and video playback. But only a problem if i\\'m in a loud room.- My only major complaint is that in weak-reception areas call reception and internet are the worst of any phone i\\'ve ever had.My partner also has a BLU phone (of a different model) and she often has full internet when i have none.- In areas with strong signal, its totally fine, and it gets good wifi reception.-The touch screen is oversensitive. (turns single taps into double taps)-The power button is in a spot where i keep accidentally hitting it when i don\\'t mean to. (But that might just be me.)-It arrived with almost no pre-loaded apps which to me is a plus.-I recommend ditching the photo editing software that came with it and installing Snapseed instead (free, versatile, and ad-free). Had a bit of trouble with the original one, but with the help of their Customer Support all came out well and I am really impressed with this watch and what it can do. I don\\'t have a data plan so can\\'t get on the internet with it, but as small as the face is a lot of what I would find on the internet would be too small or chopped up to read. It is so easy to use, installing contacts and phone numbers and I even mastered taking a picture. Haven\\'t tried the video yet.I am in my 80\\'s and got this for safety\\'s sake and really do feel safe with the ability to call 911 if I needed help. Don\\'t have to carry my big smart phone that is smarter than me, so I don\\'t feel inadequate now.If it doesn\\'t work when you get it work with the CS folks. They will figure out what you are trying to question them about and help. I returned one that didn\\'t seem to work, they mailed another that got lost in the Christmas rush, then sent me another and it works well, I even understand how to use it. Just what I needed. And so glad I persisted and so did their Customer Service folks. The product was not water proof & did not specify arrived as expected. Very good shape ,will replace old broken phone . OLd phone was going to cost over one hundred dollars to repair Extremely good!! good Good stuff but so far can\\'t get 4G LTE and the ring tone is not working, the rest of the notifications sounds are OK, only the incoming calls does not make any sound at all. So I guess is a issue. Not a bad watch! But does not do half of what it says in the description or have half the apps! The audio is not loud enough to hear and the ear buds are huge! But this watch is good for a first smartwatch Really good phone. Very responsive and the picture quality is great. Lightweight and sleekDidn\\'t know if I\\'d like a windows phone, but it\\'s a good purchase although i have an iphone 4 now, this was a great phone! it was small but i loved it. I recommend it for young preteens. Excellent HI everyone I\\'m from United States new York city and only work with t mobile but it will work with at&t but phone/Yes texting/yes Internet/no Offer some great protection from drops and scratches. If your hands are wet liquid will wick under and up the screen protector. Difficult to take off without good fingernails. I have used many otterboc defenders and my devices always look brand new when I upgrade/trade in. Works in Venezuela Great I purchased this for my Samsung S5, I love the purple and gun metal color combination. The protector screen is built right in. This was an excellent buy. It was easy to install. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to protect their cell phone in case of accidents. perfect, the cellphone run really well I houp works in another country.any way thank\\'s. Not a global 4G LTE band, don\\'t suport (B3)I bought this phone because I thought it was really unlocked 4G LTE world is global and even 3G UMTS is only ( 2G) GSM Quad Band Unlocked Love it I have had this phone for 3 days now and I found out that you have to be very careful when downloading TalkBack app from Google play store. I downloaded this app and I couldn\\'t scroll in my settings menu any longer. Once that happened I couldn\\'t scroll down to reset my phone. I looked all over the internet and finally found a reference to my problem and when you open your settings menu and you can\\'t scroll it after downloading this app what you have to do is swipe two fingers diagonally across the face of your phone. When I first tried this I was swiping across and up and down but by accident I just tried it any old way and when I did it diagonally on the settings page it started scrolling. I thought this might help some of you if you run into this problem. This is the only problem I have had so far. I gave this phone 5 stars because I should have checked ahead of time before downloadingany apps. Also I want to emphasize that this phone S4010u uses a standard size SIM card and not a micro SIM card. I found this out through Consumer Cellular.Update: This phone is really a good working phone. I have had no problems with it except the app mentioned in my first review. This phone does everything that any smartphone is suppose to do. I really like it.Update: October 24. This phone is still working very good and the battery charge last me a day. No problems with this phone. GOOD PRODUCT Nice phone, price and customer service. But device started to give problem with the power button after few weeks. Nothing that couldn\\'t be fix but it takes away the satisfaction of thinking I made such an amazing deal. The phones were old not updated software but were unlocked BB needed two hours with me to update the software and get Spanish on them. the charges were not OEM and two blew up when plugged in and almost caused a fire we threw the third away. But from someone esle the price was $20 cheaper than new and not worth it. excelente Buy this product for Christmas gift to my daughter. It did not work. I do not recomiento. First of many purchases by Amazon that something is wrong. Completely disappointed. My daughter is sad. I want my dollars back to buy another. Worked great ! Was easy to get on a prepaid card and switched carriers with no fuss. COOL Watch ! junk phone and tried to return it and said its been past 30 days i think you should have longer than that now im stuck with this junky phone nice Love this phone Good I purchased this new Palm Pre 2 because no one else sells it and I had to update my old Palm Pre 2 because it just wasn\\'t working right anymore. So far I\\'m loving my new Palm Pre 2. I wish this company was still in existence because I prefer the WebOS so much better. You can\\'t go wrong buying this product from Amazon, it\\'s great delivery, packaging and service. Exelent EXCELENT GOD BLESS I am very happy with this purchase , fast shipping a product of excellent quality, very good seller One of the best phones I\\'ve ever had, is my first HTC and I\\'m very happy with it, excellent in quality and price. Good HD screen 5 inches, with a very vivid colors. Very nice in design, excellent materials used, good performance with games and applications ... but not everything is perfect, since it only has 8GB of internal memory and only the system occupies 4GB, and when downloading and update the applications more Used by all we have 2.2gb, of course can be solved with sd memory but only for certain applications. I would have loved to have 16 GB of memory and a battery of 3000mah, but for the price that has this equipment I think very reasonable all the features it has.I do not regret having this phone and from now on I stay with the HTC devices. Ordered this phone as a replacement for the same model until my contract expires and I can get a new one. Seller confirmation said delivery could take up to 7 days. Seller sent out the phone within hours of receiving the order and I had the phone the next day. Phone looks better than described was able to transfer data from the old one to the new one with no problems. Highly recommend this seller I dont think this is completely unlock. because I have to try 2 different companies to make it work. and still its not working properly, sometimes when im in the phone the other personcant hear me or turn off by itself or gets to hot I received a broken phone. I have already sent it back and it was received. I just had to find a different phone that would work with my service provider. I love this phone. It does exactly what I want, which is make and receive phone calls. The e-ink screen is very easy to see. The battery lasts a long time. Text messaging works fine, but I rarely do it. I chose to buy it directly from Amazon, since it was pretty cheap and returning it would be easy if necessary. The volume and clarity is good. The build quality feels good. It is small and easily fits comfortably in my pocket. There was no \"default language\", instead when I turned it on it asked me to choose between Spanish, Portuguese, and English. Documentation for it easy to find on the Motorola website and the Wikipedia.I have no complaints. It is exactly what I expected and wanted. Not satisfied if u like 6s and u dont like its size, get SE Great My phone do not be quiet when it is in silent mode especially when I take a pic.in addition, they gave me low quality earphones. I purchased this UNLOCKED Samsung Focus I917 with BUYING IT and definitively it is a great option to save money because offer the most important features that any expensive smartphones must have, but it cost less than 50% of them. Its designs is very attractive, runs WiFi very fast, sound of speakers is great and loud, etc. I UPDATED the WINDOWS Operative System (OS) thru the Zune program installed in my PC without any problem. Now I can get more apps and some phone functions are now performed in a more efficient way. I know that some persons have concerns because they believe that updating the OS could \"lock\" the phone. In my experience the \"unlock condition\" was not impacted and the phone is now running with the last phone Windows version. I am using this phone with a Mexico SIM card (Telcel) and is functioning perfect. I also tested it with a SIM card of USA and worked fine too. I think it is a great option for the cell phone users in Mexico and anywhere.... I think it is not necessary to purchase smartphones of $ 500 or $ 600 dlls.... This Samsung has the same powerful performance of the expensive smartphones at a very attractive price. Horrible phone now. I worked properly for 3 months but now i am not able to turn on the phone as it will turn off automatically. Also unable to charge this phone. Every one should avoid this product. I bought it used but.... I only used it few months because does not functioned anymore, it seems like dead. don\\'t accept reparation .to bad! sorry! I got the C905A AT&T locked phone. (I will get AT&T to unlock this phone in two years when its contract is up.)The phone and camera is fun.The instructions are deplorable. Someone fired any talent they might have had in the instruction manual department for sure! Maybe this is a result of meddling by \"the NEW AT&T\", I dont know but someone made an unholy mess of the owner\\'s manual. Undefined terms, sloppy wording that is inaccurate, features not mentioned and other features with major subfeatures missing. For example there is no mention of MP3 anywhere in the manual and yet you can load songs with ease and the phone will play them. Instructions for operation of the volume control is wrong. Reference to \"hands free\" which term they dont bother to define: \"plug in the hands free\" to make an antenna for the FM.For the big money they ask for this phone I am disappointed. good The cell phone that we purchase was a great deal ! Yeah there was some starches on it ! It does the job which highly needed for texting! It is a lifeline support for a love one ! Who needs to keep in touch ! So thank you Great phone, exactly as in the photos. Beautiful. Great product ! Really looked like new ! Am a very happy customer I think I got a new one 😂 I like the could it\\'s true to the picture. Takes a little getting use to, not quite as user friendly as I\\'d hoped but really worth the price Very happy with this phone and its features. Great cell phone! the phone works good but it was not the color I chose pedi white as in the photo that you offer me to get blue sky from white to blue sky is much difference really was not what I expected or better is not what pedi the phone is very instable after 30 days. constantly drop signals. Have to restart it multiple times a day. I tried to contact the seller and got no reply back. too bad I can\\'t return or exchange it. Phone is defective, nobody can hear me on the other end of the phone. I was told this phone was inspected, but obviously not!!!Plus they want me to pay for shipping return! RIP OFF Horrible. Battery life and charging system sucks. Major glitches in software I am really dissapointed with this phone. I was advertised as new, but was refurbished. I can hardly hear the person talking. After receiving the phone i had to pay a specialty store 25.00 to enable the phone to send and receive pics. excellente This purchase was not made for reasons beyond our control. Thank you. very nice phone Good It is very good smartphone. Good price excelent camera and very fast This item arrived defective me, and as it has lost money guarantee. I bought two (2) and with different vendors and both arrived damaged. I recommend NOT BUY. IT IS A SCAM .. I bought this phone and gave it to my niece for Christmas and the button with the number 8 on it was in the 7 spot and the 8 spot. I was not happy about it and felt like it looked like I bought a cheap phone. device is good pass my expectations of what i was looking for its a great phone and the camera is great it works fine its just a good deal muy bien ALL PERFECT!!ThankRegard I bought this to use with the Lebara France Prepaid SIM card. It never worked. It would not recognize that a SIM card was inserted. Next time I\\'ll pay the extra to have my Smart phone activated in Europe. This cheapo cell phone is not useful for anything other than a phone call. The phone is fine, the delivery was fast BUT the charger was defect and the package didn’t include the LG headphone Phone was delivered on time... All the features are great....I\\'d definitely recommend an buy again an again... Thanks blu LG Optimus P970 (White) : Unlocked International Version 4.0 inches Android GSM Phone-It has muffled noise, the receipient of this phone can hardly hear anything when she is called on Whatsapp calling,and she reports that the camera has never worked and all the buttons at the bottom of the screen never worked. Unfortunately this phone is overseas, can I retrieve & return it? Did not work does not even come ready to use needs sim card and also sd card. Product is really good. But I had order and return a device to get a fully functioning device. The first device had a speaker problem. I love this samsung galaxy s5 really everythingIs Fine & nothing problem, even the price is fair. uhm... I just got this today and its been \"updating\" for the past 3 hours and is still at 0% and says it failed initialization.....very displeased.. No me gustó Works great! Hardly any lag and it has lost of room for downloads. Great buy for overseas; would buy again! NOT TOO BAD A PRODUCT. Very satisfied never regret buying this product I love the phone but when plug up to charge it freezes up and will not charge I sent a message saying if you can send me a new connector I will replace it as I did repairs on phone\\'s for 10 years It is a ALE_L23 version, not ALE-L04 version!!! Purchased for daughter and she is very pleased with it. good price and arrived in a timely manner. Really nice watch, works well when paired with my galaxy avant. However, I just got it yesterday and the screen cracked. Is there a warranty on this? Todo bien con este teléfono, envio en un tiempo justo, perfectas condiciones, mucha responsabilidad y mis saludos desde mi patria linda VENEZUELA Product not working well product just stop working want even turn on Matt every expectation shipped quickly got here well and was easy to set up This Is a good buy brand new works pefectly...love it I\\'ll skip the detailed review as there are already numerous ones of those. This is one of the best valued phones on the market, however 3 weeks after receiving mine it automatically went into \"Guest Mode.\" Guest mode is annoying because you can\\'t view your pictures, see call logs, and probably numerous other things I never discovered. There is NO setting called guest mode so don\\'t waste your time trying to find it, ie- there is NO way to turn this mode off. I know this because I just got off the phone with BLU. It took me 4 phone calls and finally reaching a supervisor to get a fix. They e-mail you a .apk file which does fix the problem. Till this is fixed however I\\'d leave the 3 stars simply because all 3 technicians solution was for me to do a hard reset to get out of guest mode, took supervisor intervention to actually solve this. Pro\\'s: Excellent camera resolution. Clear calls Soft keypad (even though the small keys may not be the best for people fingers) Activate the flashlight with the simple touch of a button Has apps Ability to add picture of contacts and you can scroll through them on the home screen. Free Voice Guided NavigationCon\\'s: Notification icons are so small The ringer volume cannot be increased/decreased by pressing the side volume buttons alone; you must go into the menu to lower the volume or press the little \"music key\", but then there are only two options by pressing that button. Not nearly as many apps or the same apps as those found in the Android Market When playing the radio, the wired headset has to be connected in order for the radio to be heard through loudspeaker (speakerphone)Overall, I think this phone is pretty good. I chose this phone because of the free navigation, the 5mp camera, and it was a close as I could get to an Android phone without having the touch screen. Android phones cost entirely too much for them to break so easily. If you\\'re looking for a basic phone with a few extras, I would highly recommend it. Also I read on another review that someone put the phone doesn\\'t work on T-Mobile\\'s 3G network. My pre=paid plan is through T-mobile and it\\'s 3g and it works just fine. I don\\'t find it in Belgium. So although I am heavy with my phone. I love it. My iphone 5 is well protected. It is a very nice phone. Great camera and display! Light and it has a premium look. I highly recommend it! I purchase it as a gift for my son so i guess i will have to wait for his opinion on it This is the phone I wanted. It was not enough memory storage and I hate to delete app lot. I want to trade to 16gb from 8gb!! love the seller for selling it so cheap bets thing about it it was factory unlocked but what really special what that it had the old bootrom which meant i could have a untethered jailbreak on ios 6.0.1 came with everything except the cables and charger. ality of its very good seller. Excellent. This is a great phone it meets my needs even bought 2 more for family members Sent it back. It said it was straighttalk compatible but it wasn\\'t. Good replacement phone without spending a lot of money. I bought this for my daughter since she had her S4 stolen. Decent screen size and display and battery life. Lacks eq setting so the music sounds kind of mono. Great phone bought for my son and he really love no issues what so ever Item arrived fast and complete. Item matched description very well. Thank you. Looks good and worth for money OMG ALL PERFECT So far I have been completely satisfied with the product. It was within two days everything in the phone is functioning completely well and up to date. I would recommend this other buyers this deserves its 5 stars. They\\'re very professional and nice. I was looking for Photon Q and find this product under market of \"Photon Q\" with photo with keyboard. I\\'m not sure if I got something wrong or if I made something wrong. Anyway I\\'m very disappointed on my \"shopping result\". This phone works ok, only problem is I won\\'t use. Returned the phone. Didn\\'t like it. Love it Y\\'all really played me. My screen keeps freezing making my phone unresponsive to the touch (the finger ID sensor still works).. and my home button doesn\\'t work! I promise if we don\\'t work out a reasonable deal, you\\'ll be hearing from my attorney VERY soon! easy to use, the voice is clear but when I put it in the speaker it is not loud. If you like to use the headset, the voice is great. The battery stay for a long time. The screen is clear to see.I don\\'t like the way the alarm work. After it finish ringing the first time, it doesn\\'t ring again unless I click snooze. I had older Nokia and the alarm ring without keep clicking snooze. it worth the money. and easy to used. producto de gran calidad y muy economico, lo que buscaba me gusto mucho llego e perfecto estado, seguire comprando excelente Usable memory is limited not alowing many apps or pictures. great phone for this price !! Did the job so cheap! but it works! impossible to send or receive images. Size ok, very weak metal frame. pen fell on it and it already put a dent in it.Alot of useless chinese apps which you can\\'t get rid of, performance wise, it runs smoothly and without hesitation.Even heavy gaming is no problem. Startup is a little bit slow probably because of all the chinese junk starting up at the same time.I get a full day- day and a half out of one full charge. Single loudspeaker loud enough but I would have expected dual speakers like on the 8 inch phab.4g only available on Rogers Canada, 3 g only on Cricket, At&t.(Those are the only carriers I use).Good signal strengh throughout Canada and the U.S. I can say for sure because I am a long distance trucker.Pictures appear sharp enough, Device is sufficiently bright and what I especially like about it is the power input on the bottom of the phone. Shortly I bought this about 1 month ago, the OTA update for Android 6.0 came in.I do use this phone for receiving and sending docs back and forth, watching Netflix and Kodi on it, and printing and scanning.So far it hasn\\'t let me down yet. Well worth the price. Its Good So far so good. I dislike not having colored message indicator lights. it came like new with charger and had no scratches. so far everything works fine. Very happy ALL OK Blu happy if u like 6s and u dont like its size, get SE very good, excellent ive used windows phones since 2011, the first generation.... and this phone clearly is a winner, love the style, the design and the amazing pureview camera.the only problem ive had is that the phone arrived without the sim tray, but i contacted the seller and everything was agreed, he sent the sim tray and now im using the phone without a problem. Phone works really well, didn\\'t expect that since I had never had a blu phone before. But overall i\\'m very happy with the product It arrived with a broken and scratched battery so I sent it right back! excellent It\\'s not that great it does work but your better off buying Apple or Samsung they r better but if u don\\'t want anything fancy this would be good for u the keyboard is very small so it\\'s hard to text on an it says to download the app don\\'t worry about downloading the app u can connect just through the Bluetooth an the texting and calling will work I think it is hard to use but that is me Good good enjoying it! I bought two of these. Typical droid, but I have to address some obvious haters. First, screenshot works just fine. Power and volume down button at the same time for a few seconds, done. Bluetooth is not called Bluetooth, that is true. It is called WHT, and it works just fine also. Paired up no problems with shower speaker and BT headphones. Very light, large screen, 4G. What else do you want for 180. Used prime and paid 3.99 for overnight and it got here the next morning. Funny thing is it changes the name on amazon when you change the color from black to another color. Calls it a tablet, but it is a phone. Maybe some have issues with using kitkat, who knows. This is one of the worst phones I have ever had, it freezes up it shuts off and you have to remove battery to reset the phone it is a piece of crap, and I have only had it for 3 days. would not ever recommend or buy again. the phone does not work well, then I turned it on it goes crazy, I can not answer calls or messages, now after you restart I can not unlock it to access the phone functions. I do not know what to do. love it its all most been a year and phone is still good The phone is used... The phone screen freeze and have problem you can see on the screen rare button like watermark... they sell the phone in bad condition... terrible Dont buy it...when I bought this pic doesnt appaer. The put pic of new phone... :( I originally wrote a good review for this seller because I received the phone so quickly and was able to activate it with no problem.Fast forward 4 months, this phone is crap! It keeps powering off every 30 seconds. I contacted the seller Battery Assault and of course the 90 days is up. From day one when I plugged it in to charge I got messages that it wasn\\'t the correct battery for the phone. Not sure what that is suppose to mean, then I would get messages that it wasn\\'t the right cable for the phone. I thought you could use any charger that fit, but I was using the original charger anyway. I will NEVER buy another phone from them or anyone online. You definitely get what you pay for, roughly 4 months of use. Not worth it. product did not work nice This cellphone is really amazing if you compare price with functionality, size, screen, apps and interface. Excellent choice if you\\'re looking for something cheap and close to a smartphone. wife loves it I got this phone about a week ago and I have to say I am very impressed. The negative reviews intimidated me but I decided to make my own decision and buy it.The phone is fast, it hardly lags while watching videos or while I do many things at once. The display is beautiful. Pictures are great too, but videos are not. But I don\\'t mind that. If I wanted very good video quality I would just buy a video camera. The thing that concerned me the most was speed and capability. Well, it sure can handle it. I\\'ve used it to watch movies on Netflix and I\\'ve had no problem. Give it a try if you want and are not too picky or like me, you don\\'t have 500 dollars for a new Galaxy. I think you will be satisfied. Pretty good phone. No complaints A++ Wonderful device. Phone size,style and color is amazing exactly what u expect... But the lag in the screen is ridiculous and should be fixed asap...idk how the expect this phone to compete with other big market androids if the speed is not even close to be on the same level as any galaxy S3 or better android...its bout as slow as the note 1 Besides needing a extra sim card and a blue tooth head phone this watch works great. The price is great to a lot less then the $ 200.00 that the other guys are asking. I was truly impressed when I first took it out of the box but I got over it in the first cpl hours. Screen constantly glitches out, auto rotation for screen only works if you shake the piss out of it. I\\'m not returning it simply because I want the satisfaction of shooting it when my new phone comes in. Very capable and user-friendly phone. It is under-rated out in the market, Iv\\'e never quite got used to the iphone and droid style phones, there a little to fragile for my line of work. The Samsung Convoy is able to take a beating and still keeps on working and thats why like the basic flip phone. Excelente I received my phone yesterday and it worked perfectly. I had a slight problem but the seller was fast to solve it!! It\\'s very very nice, buy it !!!! Bien... Tell me bout the warranty.. Not too bad for the price! Thanks I like it Excellent phone, colorfull screen, it suprised me because I was not sure because of the ppi density, but I am satisfied, Samsung has its magic. It is fast, I am still loading apps continues fast, so far. Nokia E71 Unlocked Cell Phone with 3.2 MP Camera, 3G, Media Player, GPS, Wi-Fi, MicroSD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (Gray)EXCELLENT CELPHONE Was just as described and did not tale long to arrive. Everything was great!! QWERTY keypad is miserable, the keypad appears to be lower than normal, and leads to s lot of typos. Overall the phone works well and thanks to a recent android update the battery lasts alot longer. Nothing compared to my old moto G though.The phone is a little buggy. For example the driving app (application meant to make using apps while driving easier) always turns on for no apparent reason. I turned it off in the settings but it still decides to come back and haunt me with it\\'s constant inconveniences. Right in the middle of a text or something it will switch to driving mode and then to exit I must go back to the main screen. In most cases I\\'ll haveto exit driving mode 4 times before it lets me be and finish my text.Another gripe is that texting is not very accurate and laggy at times.Also the screen is a it large. I have normal sized hands and feel like I\\'m doing thumb yoga every app I use. This item arrived new in the box, with everything encluded. I first decided to buy the phone because it was relatively within my budget and I\\'ve never really been one for fancy phones. A couple weeks after I received it, the phone started acting funny. When I changed to a different screen, I\\'d notice that the screen I was on before would remain in the background FOREVER, I kid you not! Videos are not really clear, but sound quality is really good(louder than my laptop!) Overall, if you dont have another choice, it\\'ll do. But I don\\'t see it as a good quality long-term cellphone. I\\'ve only had this phone 3 days so I will review as much as possible. It seems to b fast I don\\'t have many apps on it so there is no reason for it to b slow right now. when im talking on the phone the ear speaker makes a cracking noise but I can still hear. I have several different Bluetooth headsets some work with this phone some don\\'t. I\\'m charging my LG headset right now Im hoping it will work. ok now the fact that it only comes with a silicone case and u can\\'t buy cases. I read a review that someone posted it said to order a case for a samsung mega 6.3. I did some comparing b4 i ordered and figured out the HARD CASES WILL NOT WORK. I ordered one of the wallet cases For the mega 6.3. This phone will fit in the silicone case attached to the wallet case but the only things that line up correctly is the camera not the flash and the back speaker. So I got creative and took a razor cut the case off of the wallet case and hot glued the case that came with the phone to the wallet case... PERFECT FIT!! And while I had the razor cut the hole for the flash. it\\'s a great phone for the price! The batery is bad and this phone is Hot with talk, tanks The item was not working at all IT is very good I didnt like it, it cudnt power on.. Excellent, everything was ok, the item is new in box and works like I thought. The item is like in the pictures. great case! has good texture so I don\\'t lose my grip. wonderful phone. It is super cheap so I was expecting a pretty bad device, but it\\'s really good. By far the best 4.3\" phone. Excellent. Highly recomendable Everything I expected the real deal outter box clip only thing about this one is that the clip part does not rotate. Awesome awesome product I used this phone exclusively for over a week but could not tolerate its shortcomings. I like the large, bright screen and how it feels in my hand. I also like that they don\\'t use software buttons. You get to use all of your screen, unlike some phones like the new Moto-X Pure. However, these positives were more than cancelled out by the following issues;1) Wi-Fi connectivity - barely connects to access points that my other phones access with ease. I\\'ve had to turn Wi-Fi off several times on the Pure XL just to get online.2) Battery life no where near what I expected. The first 2 cycles wouldn\\'t last all day. After a week it did get much better but still sub-par.3) Voice recognition barely works (on occasion) and \"Okay Google\" not working at all even with Google Now launcher. Plus, Android won\\'t accept voice commands while the screen is off, like Cortana can. I could have dealt with that by itself.4) Although I like that they used capacitive buttons as opposed to software buttons, they are small and are not backlit. Most times it took at least 2 tries to hit the outside buttons especially in limited lighting conditions.Recently used phones: Nokia Lumia 1520 since it launched until about 6 weeks ago when I started using a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 until I got the BLU Pure XL. I am back to the Nokia Lumia 1520 wit its incredible battery life, Cortana and no junk ware. I purchased this new iphone 5c and went to Sprint to activate it. I was told by Sprint that this phone is a stolen one, and can not be activated!!!!! I like this phone Good Product was good overall but the person on the other end could not hear while on speaker... was definitely not a network issue. Great protection and a good price. Highly reccomend Ordered phone . great shipping . Would have been better if I could use it on my account like the description stated . All esa good EQUIPO EN BUEN ESTADO DE FUNCIONAMIENTO SIMPLEMENTE GENIAL , GRACIAS UN CORDIAL SALUDOS DESDE VENEZUELA EXCELENTE EQUIPO ..... SI LO ES I really wanted to like this phone, b/c the specs, on paper, seemed good and the price seemed reasonable. I like to take a lot of pictures and videos w/ my phone, so naturally, I place a high priority on camera and video quality. I had high hopes for this phone given its 13MP camera, but obviously, the megapixel numbers don\\'t mean much in this case. While picture and video quality is adequate in good light, though the colors were rather dull, in low light the picture quality for both still and video was extremely poor. Attempts to adjust the exposure by changing the settings did not help. Also, the settings are unnecessarily complicated and don\\'t result in better pictures or videos. It seems what this camera needs is a better quality image sensor and smarter auto settings.. Aside from that, there was an annoying problem which ultimately convinced me that I should return this phone. There was an inexplicable, intermittent glitch in the On/Off function that wouldn\\'t go away; I don\\'t know for sure if this is mechanical or software issue, but what was happening was that every now and then, after shutting the power Off, the power button became unresponsive as though the phone were dead. The only way I could get it to power On again was to first remove the battery and then put it back in. Since I was intending to use this phone on a trip to Europe this summer, I did not want to take the risk of this phone going totally dead during my travels. As such, I am returning this phone. Other minor complaints would be that the speaker doesn\\'t sound good, and also the included earbuds sound really weak. As far as its other functions, everything worked well. On the T-mobile network I got good 4g LTE connection and excellent date speed consistently, no dropped calls, decent voice quality both ways, and the GPS navigation worked fine, too. All in all, if it weren\\'t for the above issues, this phone would be an acceptable product for the price, but if you are willing to settle for a low quality camera there are plenty of other comparable quality phones that cost less.Update: I have since replaced this phone w/ the Amazon Fire Phone which was on sale for under $200 w/ 1 yr of Prime included, and am very happy w/ the decision. The camera on the Fire Phone has superb low light performance - it is better than most other camera phones out there, regardless of price. all ok All I can say about the IPhone is I Love love love my phone thanks apple I almost never put my iPhone down it is glued to me my true love lol lol excellent So many features, so easy to use!! Good This phone is extremely hard to read and not very user friendly. I had got this phone for my mom who had a Motorola phone which is the same size, but this one has very small print and only options is to change it to smaller print. I have only ever owed Samsung phones and love them, but this was such a disappointment. I gave it 1 star because it came right away.I also have never written a review, but I felt this should be know. She likes it. I bought this phone to use it in Venezuela, it came locked to be used only with AT&T \"Not as Advertised\" Works great thanks nice job Piece of crap. Could have spent that money on a better phone. Perfect Thank you broke after a week not as heavy as original ! I know it is a silly idea but I want to use a cell phone to talk to people. I have speakers for music and GPS and cameras I just want to hear people and have them hear me. What a concept. Tried a pile of blue tooth set and nothing but complaints. Must charge etc. I have plenty of wonderful wired headsets with boom mikes. That is what people who talk on phones use who want people to hear them. Plug standard three conductor 2.5 MM plug into headset and I can hear peachy keen but it uses mike on the phone not the boom mike. Try adaptors galore. None work. Stumble over two accessories on Nokia Europe WH-200 and HDB-5. Both over the ear with boom mike. I make the usual useless call to Nokia. \"sorry sir that is not available to you.\" Apparently Americans just listen to music and play games on their phones. Oh I tried a 3.5mm adapter on the E62 to a 2.5 mm headset and it did not work either. I tried a Sony with their proprietary plug and it kept losing contact. I tried a Motorola with the mini-usb and the phone answers by default when the plug is in and cannot be charged while on the phone. On to the Blackberry...next..... Awesome phone Im so terribly disappointed this is my second Blu Life XL in less than 1 year 3 months that have overheated on me and have died.my last purchase was in May of this year 2016 and within the last few weeks phone started feeling very hot and now it will not take the charge and locks its self off. Took it to be repaired and was told again that it makes no sense getting a battery or trying to fix cause the phone is no goodtotal waste of my money best phone ever No what i order t camera and design*update* still love the phone as much as I did.be sure to get a case it would be a shame to dent/scratch this beauty.the ppi is definitely noticeable.it\\'s only a 1080p screen but again the pixel density makes up for it.NFc technology is active if your into tech. I replaced my older RAZR V3m that I dropped on concrete with this exact duplicate. It\\'s a great little phone if you don\\'t want or need all the bells and whistled. And for the price, a very good deal. The was in almost perfect condition. No scratches on the screen or body. I was very impressed with the phone. I would definitely recommend this seller. The phone was in better shape than I expected since the price was so low. I\\'ve been using this phone for a week now. I also own the Lumia 1520 and had been using it for over a year until I ruined it by installing the Windows 10 Technical Preview so I went for the 640 XL. Contrary to most reviews of these phones, I personally give the 1520 4 stars and the 640 XL Dual SIM 5 stars. On paper it looks like the 1520 is the superior phone but if you\\'re willing to drop a little sharpness in the screen resolution (and camera picture size) then the 640 XL is the definite easy winner because:1. Everything is smoother, more responsive and stable on the 640 XL.2. Battery life, I get more out of the 640 XL though it is a smaller battery it uses less power.3. The form factor is MUCH better, no more square sharp corners AND the weight of it is lighter, no more heavy bulkiness. I really like picking up the new phone and feeling it in my hand.4. Looks - get the white cover (trust me)5. Cost - you get much more value6. Gorilla glass 3 - more impact resistant. I once shattered the 1520 screen (Gorilla Glass 2 and less plastic frame to protect the edges) dropping it just 3 feet. It was expensive to fix! i didn\\'t realize that this phone doesn\\'t have a zoom but of the reste everything it\\'s ok.. it\\'s working without problems. excellent working phone, no problems at all. perfect in every way :-) Awesome as described.best phone for low price.i highly recommend this phone.and the cam quality is fabulous. GOOD I like this because the price was rightFor the products,Samsung is one of the top phones and i need a change to a bigger phone I bought 2 of these phones I love them. They are terrific much more than I expected excelente Very good all 100 % RECOMENDADO This phone is fantastic for the price and the build quality was excellent. However Sprint stated the phone cannot be activated since it is not in their database as an approved device for their \"Bring Your Own Phone\" program. According to Sprint\\'s website only the Moto G4 and Moto G4 Plus are eligible to be activated. In store the rep tried to activate the Play and was unsuccessful. Got this to replace my old 2G flip phone which will stop working when 2G is phased out where I am soon. Did not need or want to carry around what\\'s basically a $300 computer with a 5 inch screen. Nor do I want to pay for a data plan. This is WiFi enabled so I can still get online if my tablet isn\\'t handy.Had to download a T9 keyboard. I was used to that format and the screen is too small to use the qwerty without a stylus. Texting at the same speed as my old flip.Others have noted that it needs an extended (8mm) tip micro usb cable.The sim size is MICRO. That\\'s the middle size between nano and mini that are used in cell phones. I had to order an adapter. Seems crazy that the Poshmobile.com site lists the sim card size as \"regular\". Rather subjective....Not for surfing or gaming, but if you just want a PHONE that won\\'t sag your pants or require a purse, this is it. Great phone works well, I really like it. What for a phone. Amazing .Just loving it. I suggest it to everyone Purchased for my niece. She loves the iphone. Very nice and good quality Beautiful screen.Awesome display.Snappy performanceThe only problem I have with this device is the battery life other wise very satisfied I love it best phone I ever owned and seen WE HAVE 3 OF THESE PHONES AND WE NEEDED A REPLACEMENT. WE COULDNT GET IT AT THE VERIZON STORE. AMAZON HAD IT, WE GOT IT IN 3 DAYS I CALLED VERIZON WITH THE SN# PUT THE BATTERY IN AND IT WORKED. IT WORKS ON OUR EXISTING PLAN NO EXTRA FEES. IT\\'S NOT A SMART PHONE BUT ITS GOOD FOR CALLING AND TEXTING GOOD QWERTY KYBD IT FITS IN YOUR POCKET AND IT\\'S DURABLE. I love my octane! I went swimming with my other one and was so glad to find this one because verizon does not carry it anymore. Latest software build is intended for older phones making it sketchy on some APS like maps. Excellent product. Good seller. Great phone. Own both the edge and s7 and would recommend the regular s7 over the edge because of the annoying inputs you get just by holding the phone due to the screen wrapping on the edges. Yet to get a case for the edge since I prefer no case but will have to try one as I heard it helps fix the accidental touches greatly. The s7 feels great and boasts impressive hardware and a 1440p screen. The battery is also decent at 3000 mah. Definitely one of the best smart phones on the market and easily outshines the iPhone I absolutely love this phone. Glad I spent my money on this. I\\'ve had this phone for almost a year. I use it on the T-Mobile network and the LTE works great. The camera is great! The screen is only 4k if you are looking at pictures in the Albums app and the default sony video player. The battery life is great as long as you don\\'t keep needless features on while not using them. The waterproofing is great, I\\'ve washed the phone in the shower several times and it has not failed. I think it is funny that other brands are just now water proofing their phones, Sony is way ahead of the curve in that aspect. The power button integrated finger print scanner is a nice touch,so you don\\'t always have to enter an unlock code. Overall the phone is great and I waited almost a year just to write a review because I really wanted to thoroughly use and test the phone. NOT GOOD AT ALL Order completed and delivered as expected. Product in new condition. All good. Very good. Running good Excelente Bluetooth kept disconnecting. I was not happy with the number of button clicks needed to do simple things, like review texts. Returned and got a quick refund. I like I like I bought this phone last month and it works perfectly...Like normal blackberry\\'s. I was skeptical about buying it online but it was great. The seller to choose is Wireovia.. They are prompt and answers you as soon as you want to query. Buying it from my seller you get a silicone case and a hard case :) I have had this phone for about a year now and in my honest opinion DON\\'T BUY IT. There is a reason it is so cheap. You only get 4GB of storage for your own personal use and when you get an app, it says that you have no storage when you do. Even with an SD Card. Also, the phone crashes all the time, it is laggy, and it is just an overall nuisance. I HIGHLY recommend that you don\\'t get this phone; it is a waste of you money. I purchased the gold 16 GB variation of the iPhone 5s and it is so beautiful for a device. The gold color on the back is very light, more like a champagne color, but it\\'s a very unique and unseen color for any phone, which makes, whoever buys it, stand out and unique. it\\'s an iPhone, so that only means that it\\'s synonymous with greatness! I love the new, fresh OS that came preloaded on the device, and the hardware is excellent too, especially the newly-debuted fingerprint reader. This phone is just downright simplistic and user-friendly that even your nana or grandpa can use it. I have used Android devices for some time. Recently I noticed even the inexpensive phone aren\\'t so inexpensive any more. and the quality is hit or miss. 6 months later and you can have an unusable device. I finally took the plung on ole \\'BLU\\' here. Glad I did. with a screen size have again as large as my previous phone, very quick response, and a great speakers. What a deal. I will start purchasing for other family members as funds allow. What a great buy! I am very pleased of the phone that I received!! It came earlier than expected and looked like new!!! This is my second POSH and my second smartphone. I upgraded because I wanted GPS. My sister is going to take my old Pegasus which is still functioning fine. I love my Titan, definately a crisper display and camera, but most of all it is super fast. I have to get my data working on it though. I don\\'t think it is the phone, I think it is something with configuring and setting it up. Had to do something special with the pegasus too to get it set up. Chatting now with my carrier to see if they can help me. It is a very large screen, so I am going to gift my ASUS tablet to someone as I really don\\'t need it anymore. This phone is faster than my tablet. The item was in excellent condition I am VERY DISAPOINTED WITH THIS PHONE. I have owned several BLU phones and loves all of them. This phone is the worst phone I\\'ve ever owned. I like the size only. The operating system is the worst. I don\\'t get 75-80% of my call. Calls I do receive are poor quality, I can hardly understand what\\'s being said. It is not able to go to any sites, even sites I have previously visited. Even in my home, on my wifi, it times out on searched several times, sometime finally will go to a site. Most times I just give up trying and get on my laptop. I do not recommend the BLU XL to anyone, and I will not purchase another on. I had great service with several BLU STUDIO 6.0. I am going to shelf this one and buy a STUDIO 6.0. I have yet to receive this merchandise and their is no contact info. Please help me AMAZON! I bought 3 ,one died after 2 weeks.unfortunately i couldnt get in touch with amazon😢😢😢😢😢😢😢. The figo phone it take\\'s too long to load and the screen freeze at times I\\'m thinking about sending it back....It is not worth the for money paid for honestly. Thanks loved it I love it 😊 Verizon indicates that the phone is not compatible with their system Excellent product and seller worthy A-Star, but the problem lies in the same machine moving and difficult transitions between menusAnd clarity of the screen and the camera is very bad because the screen broke, unfortunately, after installing the battery and this shows that the device must be dealt with Ktaaof with a bomb that is to say a very sensitive device at any impelling unbreakable such as eggThis is my point of view the device in either the seller is excellent and dealing with a very sophisticated I visor it is a cheap phone, with limited functionality. Probably good for a student, as it is strongest with photos, media, etc. I can\\'t keep it charged, almost daily needs juice, but works fine when charged. it ruans very slow Basic cell phone with Bluetooth. Excellent value for the money. the volume will not work on the phone because the rubber on the case is too long and bends out of the way instead of pushing the phone buttons, everything else looks and works great! Everything was as expected. Perfect! This review will be less about the product itself (because we all know this is an amazing, powerful, fast, feature-packed flagship smartphone) and more about SIM Compatibility/Network. Because that\\'s why we\\'re looking at unlocked phones, right?I digress. In June, I bought the Straight Talk Samsung Galaxy SIII from WalMart for $459.99. I thought it an amazing purchase that I would not regret... I was so wrong. Little did I know it was a CDMA phone (locked to Straight Talk) and it ran on the SPRINT network. This meant little to me then, but it means the world to me now, because I now know that Sprint is the most awful, bogged-down, spotty, insert-derogatory-phrase-here network on this entire planet. I live in Hawaii, and Sprint\\'s network in Hawaii is an absolute joke. I had no service at my own house OR my workplace that was right on the convergence line of two Sprint towers (Sprint can\\'t switch towers very easily so just went into roaming). The closest Sprint tower to my house had a coverage radius of roughly 1 mile, and still does. And worst of all, it\\'s a 3G-only network. Not a regular 3G network, either. I got EDGE speeds at best. I\\'ve never pulled more than 1Mbps on the up or down. Straight Talk\\'s S3 was also very watered down, with a locked bootloader and very limited software accessibility. It was a sad life for me.I had had it. I was done with this pitiful excuse for a carrier. All my friends had either AT&T or Verizon, who both had full LTE buildouts here. They always pulled webpages and videos like lightning. Their coverage was broad and consistent. I figured it was time to pinch a few pennies. I had heard that Straight Talk had released an LTE-capable AT&T SIM Card, and I needed a phone for it to power. I had my heart pretty much set on the S4, but didn\\'t know which one to get.This was the one.The product arrived brand-new and completely unopened. Shiny new S4. I put it in the wall, popped the SIM in, edited the APN settings ([...]) and BAM. The 4G LTE icon popped up in the status bar, as well as two consistent bars of service. My experience thus far has been wonderful - I\\'ve been pulling a pretty steady 15up/19down everywhere I\\'ve been thus far. I now have coverage in my home. I have yet to see the NO SERVICE icon. This may not be a problem for many of you as you may be already coming from AT&T\\'s network - but it\\'s a whole different world for me.TL;DR? This phone works perfectly with Straight Talk\\'s AT&T Micro SIM card. There is no hassle and no fuss - I set it up entirely online in 10 minutes. If these qualifications meet your criteria, buy this sucker - you won\\'t be disappointed. Everything ok Bought this as a present for my son - he\\'s quite happy with it and it works perfectly. So far so good. i brought this phone for a friend of mine mother ,after seeing it and how it works i ended up ordering two more a golden white for myself and a slate gray for a friend. The phone works great i have had no problems with it and the delivery was very very fast they said 3 to 5 days and i got it in about 24hrs.To the persons who handle my order great work keep it up, i will be ordering again soon. Cool More than pleased with the I phone 5 unlocked met my requirements decent phone but the stylus is garbage, I pulled it out for the first time and it broke, leaving half of it in the phone. I really love this phone.Excellent camera quality.Only thing is that it uses a mini Sim and not the micro ones so I\\'ll need to get a new one but great overall! Also excellent customer service. It took a few days to arrive but good service. It\\'s not the best but it\\'s pretty good for the price Watch is crap! Can\\'t find al bt notification apps that will let me use half the the features. I have a Verizon and not compatible to get a Sims card with them. Waste of money. super This phone is AWESOME for the price. It does everything the big box phones do. No issues with it Excellent I had this HTC Evo 4g for 4 years when it did finely fall out of my hands onto the concrete and bought another one instead of upgrading because this android phone was a leader in new technologies and it still today stands the test of time... So I had to buy another one 4 years later... Loved the phone. was well packed and received it on time without any delays. Looking forward to use the phone I had bought 2 of these to replace the ancient phones my kids were using. After seeing them in action for a couple of months, I got myself one as well to replace my aged S2. (The multitude of available colors is great!) It may not be a massive powerhouse like the newest flagship phones from the big name brand companies, but at such a small fraction of their price it\\'s definitely nothing to scoff at and it performs excellent!The lack of LTE may turn some people off, but it\\'s still plenty fast on regular 4G for me. (T-mo) My only real complaint is the small (8gb) built-in memory size, as it should really be at least 16gb+ these days with so many of the popular apps requiring installation on the internal storage rather than SD. Memory is cheap these days so it really wouldn\\'t take much to increase this. I gladly would\\'ve dropped an extra $50 for a 16gb version of this phone. (And probably will if they end up creating higher-memory models!)Overall, this phone is downright amazing for the price point. If you want a decent android phone for a great price and you\\'re not concerned about having \\'the next big thing\\' from the name brand companies, give this phone some serious consideration! Phone works but internet doesn\\'t work and sd slot doesn\\'t work so how do you put anything onit music or video Excelente producto. Inntime all perfect superb, works very well for Venezuela AFTER I PUT THE SIM CARD IN AND THEN THE BATTERY I ONLY GET SERVICE UNTIL I MOVE IT OR TRY TO USE IT. THEN I HAVE REMOVE THE BATTERY AND REINSERT THE SIM. IT HAS BEEN A VERY BIG DISAPOINTMENHT. I DO LIKE THE IDEA OF A WATCH PHONE THOUGH. I AM IN BELIZE NOW WHERE I RECEIVED THE WATCH NOW I CAN\\'T RETURN IT. Speedy delivery and works great The description didn\\'t say the phone would all be in Spanish! The box & instructions were all in Spanish. Took a whole lot if trial & error to change the setting to English. IN LOVE WITH MY PHONE!!!! I bought it as an international client, and was a little bit scared, but it was the biggest online \"risk\" I ever took and was rewarded.........Thank you for my great service Samsung My friend loved it! Yes it came very fast perfect condition everything my teenager daughter wanted thanks I love it Slower than I thought. Freezes at times. Doesn\\'t work in Europe GSM 900/1800MHz Tmobile. It works but it came with missing internal components like screws and metal plates that secure wires. Bought it for my friend. He likes it. I purchased it for a friend of mine in Jamaica. I called him frantically all day trying to reach him . I couldn\\'t until 2 days later he called me to say the was dead and would not turn on. It eventually did. But still has a tendency to freeze. Would not recommend. For $50. Maybe. Fast delivery ordered Friday morning and recieved it Monday afternoon. Great phone for being used no problem with Tmobile just a new sim card purchase. Tiny knick on side of phone, a case can hide that. My son will be extremely happy with it :) Just as good as my s4 going to my daughter that I purchased new. Would purchase from again! When I received this phone, which it took about a month. I got the phone I was excited for how big it is, but after waiting so long to get the phone I couldn\\'t even use it without a sim card. Finally got the sim and found out that the internet doesn\\'t work, which means the google play store doesn\\'t work, which means I cant do anything with this phone but call and text. This sucks because im into apps and the internet. Am I the only one who had this problem????? This product is total garbage.. Can\\'t go wrong with an iphone. This has been my favorite phone. When my old one started acting up, my grandson suggested I look online for one. I found this and it was delivered in perfect time, as my other one died. Very happy to have a new phone. Been using it for almsot 2 days and haven\\'t encountered any issues. It was kinda difficult to get my phone to connect because you have to install an app and some software but it\\'s sorted out with the booklet. It\\'s a great phone! Muy bueno Arrived as expected. Great condition.....works great. Good used device. 80% good. Rare camera is not working. I showed it to I-Phone tech (iphoneaid.com) in Baltimore, MD. John fixed it in 15 minutes. Checked the I-phone and replaced the rare camera with new part. Thanks to Amazon and Iphoneaid.com Bought this phone for my 12 Year Old Daughter. The phone arrived on time and was just as described. My only issue was that it is supposed to be a new phone, however, the charger was clearly used and did not work. Otherwise the phone is great. I was looking for a phone that provided me with a good camera and good screen real estate at a reasonable price and this phone fit the bill. It works great except that it sometimes lags while recording videos and while attempting to run certain apps. Other than that, its a great phone for a reasonable price. Very good I bought this phone to replace one of the same model that got destroyed. Popped in my SIM card and everything worked just as it should. No problems with phone, material, or sender. Very happy with purchase. Excellent seller and products and very nice Best phone i have ever owned Great Phone, better than my iphone 6 plus that I have from work! THIS SAMSUNG GALAXY PRIME IS A VERY NICE PHONE WORKS AND LOOKS GREAT, nice Great phone but signal reception / service for LTE T-Mobile nonexistent in rural area compared to my standard issue T-Mobile phone at same location. Perhaps modem chipset / antenna inferior? Great item Everything I expected at a much better price than its IOS counterpart. I love the color of this phone...reminds me of a frog! lol....packaging was great, timing of delivery was great....I charged it fully when I got it, used it and then started to notice that the battery did not hold the charge and now that it is cold, will just shut off....I ordered a new battery and had it installed...works great even when it is cold out! Product was in GREAT condition with generic charger/USB. Next phone will be a 6...which will probably be when they create an iphone 10....lol Excellent device STAY AWAY FROM THIS PHONE. The camera does not work. It gives an error message: \"Camera has stopped unexpectedly. An error report will be send to HTC to help us improve our products.\" Called HTC customer service. They attempted to trouble-shoot but it still did not work. Since it is an international phone, it has no warranty! Awesome. Muchos problemas al escribir excelente Lasted only a few months and then gave up. Who do I send it back to./ LOOKED AND WORKS AS I HOPED FOR WITH A REFURBISHED PHONE. SELLER ANSWERED ALL MY QUESTIONS AND WE GOT THE PHONE QUICKLY THROUGH MAIL. I AM PLEASED AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SELLER :) If u r looking for a brand new, Don\\'t go for this. I ordered and received in time. But its not a brand new. Its very refurb. Seller didn\\'t mention here whether its brand new or refurb. Tats not fair.. 2 stars for the product and for the sellers, i can say buyers beware.. The order came in time and was as described. It\\'s perfect ,the negative reviews are not true and i would definitely recommend buying from IGM PRIME awesome Phone! the delivery coming very fast. it lasted my 4 years, lol Granted, this is an older model, but I prefer to hold at least the semblance of a phone next to my ear than a wanna be iPad (iPhone 6 and others). The format was easy to learn: I also use Mac computers. I like the touch screen. Would prefer NOT to have the Apple watch icon, which so far I fail to find how to remove.I don\\'t harbor hoards of pictures, but do use the phone for my Kindle books (300+) and Solfeggio music (lots again) and the 16GB seems to be adequate for my needs. Basically, the phone is more for business than personal. It is my first experience with texting and have to admit, I have become a fan. Quick. To the point. Get \\'er done. Important in our no nonsense little time work world.IMPORTANT TO KNOW: my account with AT&T is a monthly No Contract. When I asked about a contract, the sales rep told me because this is considered a \"third party\" phone, I was not eligible for a monthly contract. That requires buying your phone from an AT&T distributor or directly from them. For me this was fine. I got a great deal with more data time than a contract arrangement and my monthly is less than $50.Another Point to Ponder: No one really tells you that with this phone (maybe others?) every month it is best to completely shut it down to reboot. After all, it is a computer. I found this out when I lost capability to enter addresses into my contacts. A friend who had used the i5s alerted me to the reboot feature. Doing this, I have not had any further problems, mechanically.CON: that in a way all Apple products are intrusive into our life by recording and keeping a digital record of EVERYTHING you do on the phone: calls, texts, web sites. I understand Android does the same, but not as intrusive as Apple. I don\\'t like this aspect at all. Be aware.PRODUCT was delivered per my special request on time. Product not exactly as described by seller and no instruction guide included. Because of some other customer service issues, I find it difficult to recommend the third party seller. The phone is spotty when it comes to charging. I plug it in and it registers that the power is plugged in, but it doesn\\'t always charge. I have to check four to five times, unplugging and plugging it back to before I might get it to charge. I also had the speaker go out within three days of using it, but that fixed itself somehow and now works again. Hi, I bought a new piece but there is some defect with the headphones. The audibility using that headphones is very bad. I can barely hear what others are saying and others can\\'t hear my response as well. I\\'m not satisfied with the functionality of the phone as well. I\\'m not happy with this piece. Don\\'t even think of buying this one. phone looks new! Works great! I sent it to my mother in India. She complains stating phone is becoming warm when she talks over the phone even for 5 minutes. I am NOT at all satisfied with the phone. It is purple/blue color. My 11yo has this and it works great. She has dropped her phone many times and no phone breakage.Update: After 6 months of using this case. The rubber has started to PEEL. I have very serious doubt that this is a real Otterbox. A real one wouldn\\'t start to peel. Buyer beware. I will only order straight from Otterbox now! Fire Everything is ok, except the battery !!!!!!!!!!!! It drains fully for 2 hours, is it ok for 4200 mAh battery ???? The phone keep cuting off and one Very thin and low battery usage. Of course, it depends on the user how long the battery will last on a single charge but this one exceeds my previous phone. It is a great phone for the price - highly recommended. I am very happy with this purchase LenavoS860 .battery life was amazing .first charge stays 7 days . But once I installed Face book figure it out battery stays for 2 days .So I decided to remove Face book App from my phone ,but it have Skype & Viber ,battery stays fir 7 days. China brand company delivery my phone in 10 days ..I recommend this phone to all very good thank you Phone came locked that only previous iTunes account holder can unlock. Went to Apple and Verizon with no luck, was advised to return phone. The phone is great. Hardware-wise everything works as it should, and the phone is touch, durable, and rugged. Only problem is that AT&T software is DEEPLY embedded into the firmware, and so if you want to use it for T-mobile (as I do) or other GSM providers, be prepared to use it strictly for phone calls and texts (and photos, though the camera is anemic at best) . No GPS, No internet, no email, not unless you have AT&T service. I did find a hack online to make the internet browser to work, but it was a pain in the rear. Unless you can find a custom ROM for this thing (which I couldn\\'t), you\\'re stuck with mostly a cell phone (Which might be OK for many of you). As far as T-mobile calls go, the phone was in fact \"unlocked\" and all i needed to do is pop in my simcard. Battery life is quite good also. For what it is, it does a good job. The app is a little hinky to get started but, after that, performs as expected. Case is great, provides great protection and phone is still easy to use and it has the Wichita State Shocker colors to boot! GO SHOCKS! Good thank you It is different from my old Android phone!!! Some things are good changes, a few things I miss!! But I love it and am still learning new things!!! Excellent Watch at that price! Perfectly fits my wrist, good design.Connect to Iphone 6s smoothly to sync calls, very surprised for the clear sound quality. Need more time to check more functions.Spend a little more time to connect to Samsung Galaxy, this watch has much more functions for Android OS phones but needs to download their APK file and install, it costs more time but made me surprised it can control my Samsung Galaxy\\'s camera.Not tested each function but this watch is really great at that price. 5 star! worst cell phone I have seen!! worst. It is failed that I bought it. It is worth $10 rather than $40. Bought as gift battery is easy to become hot I used blackberry phones for many years and for the the last few years I had several iPhones and I recently owned a Galaxy.PROs:Small, has many preinstalled applications, such as office, maps, twitter,youtube, maps and the media support is also very good. Can stream Audio via bluetooth.CONs:This phone has good features when compared to the iPhone/Galaxy however the touch feature is terrible in comparison. Sometimes it responds, sometimes it does not. There are hardly any applications in the store that are useful and installing/uninstalling applications require a full system reboot which is terrible. Furthermore, there is no way to completely turn off this phone, therefore if are having issues you will have to remove the battery. I will definitely NOT recommend this phone to anyone. I love it. Just wish there was instructions. I am not a techie. This phone along with my previous phone purchases on here were horrible. Big waste of money. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Factory Unlocked Phone 32 GB - International Version G935F- Black OynxAbsolutely disappointing, the charging port was hurt at 4 days, and today after 10 days has begun to smoke and smell of burning. I\\'ll have to repair the \"new\" cell. I\\'m angry and I\\'ll never buy in this shop. The screen was popped out. It had scratches on the back. Didn\\'t match description. I dropped it on a soft surface and my screen was jacked. I had to pay to get it fixed. Phone was exactly as expected. The EarPods didn\\'t work, but the seller replaced them promptly after I contacted them! I would have given 5 stars but... If you want to use the dual sim cards, the second card must be a nano (no big deal, any carrier will cut it down for you) but if you want to use dual sims and have external storage micro SD card, you CAN\\'T. It is designed to be one or the other.... It\\'s dual sims or 1 sim and 1 external storage micro SD card. To me that should have been explained .... I\\'ve called the spoke with BLU consumer Dept and that is exactly what they told me. Other than that, it\\'s a great phone for the price. perfect phone for the price I read a lot of reviews about this phone before I purchased it. It was a lot of good reviews and it was some bad reviews the good reviews out did the bad so I bought it and it was very very mind blowing this phone is of the chain its way better than galaxy s3. This phone has good picture quality sound quality camera quality feature quality so if u wanna buy this phone don\\'t think long on it buy it I glad I did it didn\\'t even cost that much and its a better phone than some of these or should I say a lot of these name brand phones and battery life excellent ! Do not waste your money! As described, super fast shipping! Phone works perfectly! As a person that recently got into the world of smart watches, I had to learn a lot in a short time.I\\'m writing this review while holding an iPhone because I haven\\'t seen anyone do it. It does everything as described on the description, you can control your music (it basically works as a bluetooth speaker), answer phone calls, set an alarm, track your steps, and make calls. The only things that you can\\'t do on an iPhone is get text, mail, and social media notifications, but if you have an android you should be fine. Overall the smart watch did perform to what I had expected which was good in my book. Good phone recently in use yet, very very recomend for all world than require a smart phone for work !!! Good Great phone put in at&t sim and it was go to go.Works very well.Love it well worth the money.24 month warranty also. Was a good choice very good The phone does not work with Verizon... which is not specified The balance of cost and benefits is perfect, it\\'s beautiful and light.. Good phone . Gsm isn\\'t unlocked as stated excellent Love it! Works perfect! Would recommend buying from this buyer again Awesome phone Defective upon arrive. Was not on locked like the description says ended up having to buy an unlock code online to attempt to put on my straight talk account, but the phone will not read any sim cards. Unfortunately returning the phone and back to shopping elsewhere I shan\\'t go into all the features, other reviews have them covered.You heard about the tracking hack that Google pulled? Since this needs Google, you should carefully consider how much you value your privacy before you buy.OK. Let me set the context. Albert Einstein was still alive and kicking when I was born. I do not have the best eye sight, hand-eye coordination is ok, as is hearing, hands a bit on the larger side and not as steady as they were 20 years ago.Use mostly for data, have had the phone for 2 months and not used 100 voice minutes total.The GoodNice screen. I was concerned that I\\'d have trouble typing but in landscape mode, which you just shake to get to, the keys are big enough. THe GPS feature works well for me and I\\'ve so far had great coverage and no lost calls. The menu is fairly intuitive, and with a bit of exploration is ok.The BadThey load it up with lots of rubbish apps. T-Mobile Market place and Voice Messaging are two (there was another I don\\'t recall). All useless and I\\'ve been bothered having to update them both for no purpose. When I say useless, the Market had nothing of interest to me in it and the Voice thing wouldn\\'t launch.Th battery life is about a day. Ths thing sucks power like an Abrams M1 sucks JP8. A bit longer with all power saving on, but not much.The screen goes dark 2 - 5 seconds after you dial. Thats a real problem if you call a answering system. Hard to \"press 3 for customer service\" if there is no visible 3 on the screen. This is a real bad bug. I am constantly having to push a button to \"wake up\" the screen. Of course, doing that puts me back to the main screen and I may or may not have lost the call. So, in terms of useability, this goes dim/goes dark bug (which you can not prevent from happening - I called about it) means I can not recommend this phone.I turned off auto sync (to save battery) and to my chagrin learned that unless its on, your g-mail inbox doesn\\'t check for new mail. Nowhere did I see that warning, nor did it ask me \"do you want to check for new e-mail now?\". Reminds me of software from 1998!!!There is this blank screen (screen saver?) that covers the icons after a couple of seconds too. So once the screen goes dark, pushing the on button doesn\\'t even return you to where you were before it decided 3 seconds is long enough for you to be inactive.The swiping needs work too. Sometimes response is slow; as in you push a button or swipe (to scroll) and nothing happens for several seconds. If you don\\'t wait (and forget about aubible feedback!) you can scroll right past where you want to go.The screen edges are less sensitive and I often have to repeatedly swipe or press to get any response. While in other cases I swipe but the phone interprets it as me clicking on a icon and up pops some app or another. Not cool. Its almost like they haven\\'t learned anything about user interfacing from the Macs and PC business.Two other things and I\\'m done.The off button is on the opposite edge from the sound volume rocker. This extremely poor design means if you hold it in one hand and push/squeeze it off chances are you also changed the ring volume. really poor design.Finally, I\\'ve tried four 3.5 mm headphone sets (wired) and none work with this. There are no impedance specifications listed, nor was customer service able to help. Its ridiculous. SO either I need to get a more modern pair of ear phones or the unit is defective. But come on! no impedance data for the headphone jack?!?!BTW best work-around for the screen going dark when you need access to the keypad is to set the phone on \"speaker\" phone. The Samsung forum is much more useful than Technical service = non responsive.To sum up: I don\\'t have any other smart phone to compare this with but I hear power is a problem on many of them. The GUI (user interface) is slick but crippled: I have no doubt that in a couple of years the phones will work like you excpect a phone to work, without roadblocks and frustrations. I blame the newness of the technology rather than Samsung &/or Android. I am itching to try an iPhone though...its hard to believe they are all this bad...who knows. I got this phone because I travel often and am looking forward to using it. So far it has been functional with T-mobile network.I had to purchase the phone twice because the first one I got did not turn on. The battery would say it\\'s charging but never charge and the power button did not work. So I sent that one back and got the exact same phone.The second one I have turns on and everything works except the volume control buttons on the side. However, seeing as I am travelling soon I will probably not get it replaced.I am assuming the problem is with the dealership not with the phone themselves. They need to do a quality check to make sure the phone is functional before they ship it out. I just bought this phone not long ago and its already quit on me im really upset .. don\\'t know what to do It\\'s small enough to carry always, with enough screen size. It support dual SIM with different sizes. Wanted this for travel and liked the dual SIM capability. Very lightweight and flimsy phone. Worked ok while it worked, but not it is completely dead after 6 months of very little usage. No warranty info in User Guide and only contact number is in Nigeria. I don\\'t think it is really an LG phone. It met my expectations. I am using it overseas and it works pertectally One of the Best Sony Smartphone i have used , awesome built quality . The best quality used phone! IT WOULD HAVE TO SPIT OUT $20 BILLS TO RATE IT A 5 STAR. IT\\'S FASTER THAN MY MOTOROLA A855 AND DOESN\\'T FREEZE UP THEREFORE I DON\\'T HAVE TO REBOOT IT CONSTANTLY. VERY LITTLE I DON\\'T LIKE. I CAN\\'T BLAME MY FAT THUMBS FOR HITTING SOMETHING WHICH ACTIVATES SOMETHING ELSE, THEY DON\\'T SELL THUMB GUARDS. FOR THE TIME I\\'VE HAD IT, I SURE HOPE IT STAYS IN THIS CONDITION FOR AT LEAST A COUPLE YEARS. WE\\'LL SEE. The letters on the keyboard are missing during typing, after only 4 weeks. I would expect an exchange from the seller. Otherwise great phone. But this issue makes the phone practically useless. This happened ONE Month into use. I believe this should be covered in a one year warranty. Please advise asap. Thanks. Great deal on this phone. I took a big chance and had a lot of doubt. The phone arrived on excellent condition and for the price this was a great deal. Thank you\\' Good service and totally new devicePerfect Thank you No problems activating. So far, so good. Not so bad Nice I like it a lot, been using it for a while (about 9 months), it\\'s starting to feel slow (android OS) but I guess is normal for the use. I don\\'t give it five stars because i do have an issue with the screen, suddenly a dark shadow appeared and lasted about 2 months then it disappeared and suddenly it came back a few days ago, if i\\'d live in the US i\\'d request warranty replacement. It works fine with the Venezuelan line services. Great phone I love it !!! It\\'s great 100% recommended Excelent phone everything works fine Excellent phone, all perfect, so much better than the famous and popular smartphones s4 s5 htc one iphone5 etc Polaroid should stick to cameras. 100% RECONMEDABLE .SALUDOS It\\'s a basic phone. Have not Whatsapp and the cam is very simple, but I boght it because I needed an alternative phone and this is a good option. Bought this as a gift for my daughter, mainly because it was advertised as \"certified\" refurbished and the price seemed right. The phone arrived when it said it would, but it will not hold a charge and shuts down unexpectedly minutes after a full charge. I left chasing what Apple says is likely a software issue, or purchasing a new phone. Extremely disappointed. Glitches ALOT delivered at the right time.great phone. only issues i have is with the adaptive brightness and fingerprint scanner Very cheap material and phone doesn\\'t work after two months. Problem with a sound quality and display. very bad , poor quality, wifi disconnects every few minutes , warmed when loading is very slow. I did not like anything,I would not return because I am in mexico Love it! Good I like this phone, good price. All It\\'s excellent! They told me the cellphone was new but judging by the appearance, it wasn\\'t.Then I don\\'t get my messages complete, specially when somebody text me from smart phones Good value for a starter phone. Screen and responsiveness are surprisingly good Love the S5 just wish I could have gotten one that was a T-Mobile carrier phone. I have made do, but when you have spotty service it makes it very hard to make calls or send texts. Can\\'t use wifi calling on t-mobile network. I am satisfied. .. This is the worst thing ever happen to me I bought this watch phone the phone does not working and when I tried to return the item they stop me from doing it The description says it is an unlocked cell phone, but as soon as you try to use any sim card that is not from t-mobile, cell phone shows a message \"Network locked\", \"Please contact Customer Care\". I tryied to reach WorldWide Distributors twice, but until now, I got no answer. Perfet Delivery was correct, but the version of software is not the newest and neither have the option to update; my boyfriend has the same model of another supplier and seems more advanced; I do not understand why. i really like this phone, be reeeeeally sure you want a reaaally big phone before purchase because it is huge! Better than I expected. The price is right. Totally a great phone. This is my first experience with HTC phone and its really make me happy. This phone has everything that any ideal phone should have. The best feature is 3D. The 3D experience is really far beyond my expectation!!. excelente producto So far is good Everything is so great except the battery life. It\\'s terrible and can\\'t last for a full day.If battery life is important to you, don\\'t consider this phone First of all I want to say I have been an Apple user since the iPhone 4s came out. Big Apple fan. Until I decided to switch it up and never sign a 2 year phone service contract again. Looking for a unlocked international phone in case I move out of the country, I found this. At a couple hundred dollars (cheaper than a 16gb Apple 4s) I found this phone to be affordable and impressive for the price on paper. Upon receiving the device and setting it up I was impressed at the quality and sheer screen size of the thing. It has a clear and crisp screen, lots of RAM, great camera, large battery and is very user friendly. This is my personal opinion and I am by no means a phone snob. I previously replaced an iPhone 5 16gb with the zenphone 6 and do not regret it whatsoever except for the fact tthat the iPhone was in no way needing replaced. Now I have this and absolutely love it. It is awesome and I would recommend the phone to family and friends all day. A very nice and fast device, i have no problem viewing all my documents. excellent price. fast shipping. i recommend it. Works like described. Good reception, camera and battery life. Thin size and big screen make for good viewing. Excellent sound as well. I have read a lot of articles about the note 3 and kind of knew what it should like. I think this is a keeper and will enjoy it for a long time. Like I said a great phone. I was very dissapointed in this phone. I bought a used phone that was supposed to be in very good condition. It was not. When I got it the battery was no good and I had to purchase another. Some of the buttons are worn so bad that you can\\'t read them and when you open the phone to use the qwerty the screen cannot be seen unless the phone is only half open. I will never buy from this seller again. Cutting edge phone comparable to iPhone6s in a smaller package. My daughter loves it. Great phone! I have to take the battery out to work cause it sticks im going to return it not happy with it only thing good was it was delivered on time Good. Was all I expected and more The Sony experia, is what I xpected and is intended for use oversea and the person is happy with it wow this is a very thin phone. it is very fast and has a nice screen. the camera on front and back are nice. the battery lasts a long time with heavy use. it lasts me all day with heavy use. Bluetooth and wifi works. great phone. the price is really low too. if you have any questions ask i probably did not cover everything. I messed up my new Blackberry and refused to pay the full price to get another. My daughter insisted I have a replacement, since I love Blackberry phones. This phone works great. Only thing I have not figured out is how to get the WiFi to boost my signal inside my home. I like it when a product such as the LG LX260 Rumor for Sprint works so well. My teenager loved it. The fuctions worked well. I wish I new what type of memory card goes with it. We love taking pictures and that\\'s a great way to save memories. We would be able to in-put them to any computer. It will come handy when my parents want to see the pictures and they don\\'t know how to send them. Over all very satified with the Phone.Thanks,Wendy I hate the camera on this thing. The frontface defaults to \"beautification mode\" everytime you turn it on. if you dont want digital makeup in your selfie you need to turn it off every time. buttons are ill-placed for convenient use of camera. the camera is slow as hell, the phone in general is kinda slow too. The speakers are crap, cant hear anything unless you overdrive the global EQ (nice feature!) to hell and back so everything sounds like crap anyway. Really hate myself for buying this i shoulda just got a samsung galaxy. This phone is super liqhtweight to the point it just feels flimsy. Eventually bricked out after a year or so.. Buy good deal for price love it bueno this phone is awsome i have no complains.i have had it for 4 weeks now..so far so good. I love this phone. I had looked at the Moto X 2014, Nexus 6, Samsung Note, Moto G. This phone is the best of both worlds, its a good value at $300 v. $500 or $600 for most other high end phones, while including many of the same features as the compeition. The battery life is far better then my Nexus 4. Even with moderate use the battery lasts me the whole day ! I don\\'t recommend to buy smartphones specially samsung without guarantee. In Ecuador i can\\'t use this phone because there wasn\\'t the information about the countrie which Samsung made it . I lost my money Box was opened only to unlock the phone but phone was new and I love it I like that its big its like a small tablet It\\'s a good phone but it\\'s not at&t WTF! I specifically ordered this Droid and instead got the Droid X delivered. My question is why? I got a better camera from the phone that was delivered but is an outdated model. Now I\\'m stuck with this crap Great product. My mother, like many elderly people, wanted \"just a phone.\" She does not text or email or go online or do anything except talk on a phone, and a landline did not suit her needs. She also goes through cell phones like mad because she keeps getting them wet with \"just a teenie, tiny bit of water.\" So I was REAL glad to find a cheap phone on Amazon, especially seeing as T-Mobile had exactly 1 phone that was \"just a phone\" and for twice the price of this one. So I took a gamble and ordered this one for her.Apparently it\\'s really easy to use. So easy that Mom, who could never program her VCR, has figured out how to take pictures of her cat with it. She\\'s quite hard-of-hearing and has had no trouble hearing the phone ring, and I don\\'t have to yell at her when I call her. She was thrilled that her contacts that were saved onto her old SIM card transferred to this phone just fine when I installed the card and booted it up. She especially loves just having to flip the phone open to answer, and snap it closed to hang up.It\\'s only been about a week, but so far, this phone is a huge win, both for her ease of use and for my budget. Another great phone from HTC. I\\'m a fun of their phones. Never have been disappointed. My previous HTC one X is being with me for almost 5 years and still working great. 3rd Posh phone. Overall excellent performance. Data connection is only 3G despite its claims and display of 4G. Battery life is not the best but will get you through the day for heavy users. This phone is an excellent choice, price for performance. Compre el teléfono bb 8520, decía que era nuevo, la pantalla no funcionaba, lleve al servicio técnico y me indicaron que era usado Everything ok, great product, great value I have been using smart phones since the Palm Treo 600, so I am not new to this. this is the nicest phone I have ever owned. I purchased the red one and everyone just stops and stares at it and windows 8 is great is is the best phone software available. Really great phone for the price! Nice the time constantly changes for no apparent reason, this was a \"refurbished\" evidently that doesn\\'t mean the same thing to me...you\\'d think they\\'d have corrected some of the issues, NOT frustrating that you can\\'t charge the phone unless you power it off....never have I seen this before. Steer clear of the BLU line-up, I\\'m back in the market for a Moto-X or a Samsung..these BLU are thrash FYI I had problems with the phone because it came locked when the product you sold me was saying unlocked, having to pay to use it, it will lift me 3g at times Chinese or one of those languages continually pop on screen and also there is at time background static and I cant hear or be heard by person with whom I am communicating with and the phone sticks as well on the plus side I like the features offered and can readily access them Awesome phone :) Great for protection and easy use. What\\'s not to like? Great product, as always from apple.K. Kris Loomis is the author of How to Sneak More Yoga Into Your Life and the Modern Shorts for Busy People series. Everything works great Updating took really long but it\\'s on older phone still runs pretty fast processor wise Every thing works OK except the second sim card it just won\\'t recognize it. But I\\'ll keep trying.Thanks! Este equipo es increíble no pensé que sería hermoso buena cpu y gpu un rendimiento excelente móvil Item received in the expected conditions. Love my new phone This is not a good mobile phone, I\\'m 6/18/13 buy mobile phone, is now the only 8/12/13. yesterday in the video process is suddenly interrupted, the screen is only a faint glow. But it can not be used, this is my second time to buy the mobile phone in the Amazon. The first to buy a mobile phone is in the 6/10/13 date, I gave it to my brother. Is a very bad.Their mobile phone are rubbish? I have checked the chance of no return. Return in 30 days, now only use no more than 3 months, the two mobile phone have been unable to use, I also have sought to write position, but did not find, I really do not know how to ask for help, they are also my disappointment.Amazon Co should let the factory have quality assurance, this is no reputable manufacturers, use only could no longer use no more than three months, can not boot Love it.It\\'s a great sizeUI is fastBattery life is excellent (usually use 30-50%/day)Screen is very good, don\\'t let the releativly low resolution be a deterent, it\\'s quite good even looking at very small detail.The built-in Sony apps can be somewhat annoying and not all can be uninstalled, but just hide them in a folder and turn off notification and they dont bother you.My only concerns are more with Andriod than anything Sony did. The privacy controls are insuffient, too much reliancy on google and it\\'s qutie a hassle to disable cloud based data sharing. (On the positive side you don\\'t need any relationship with Sony to use everything, a Sony account and cloud services can be skipped on startup and settings).As others have noted, this is the US SKU. That means it\\'s missing 2 features: 1 no fingerprint reader, and 2 no smart battery control. Most people know about the first one, but the lack of smart battery control is hidden in the manual. This means no \"learning your habits\" and charging a less than a max speed. Because of this I don\\'t plugin my phone overnight because I don\\'t want it to charge to 100% or do so at a rapid speed, both of which lessen your battery life in the long term. Yes it did meet my espectation . I love it. ok i ordered two phone from here so far the first was the lg voyager the second one is the lg ally i love that phone to death the main thing i like about the phone is that u have wi-fi and u can download app the camera is super good i like the flash and the sound everything is working good and the seller said the phone was used umm i think not it works like it never been touched at all but since im busy pros:wi-fi touch screen great user friendlycons:gets slow a little but it works good if u got 8gb chip not so well wit a 2gb on but other than that this a great phone :p I\\'m no techie or heavy user, so this has worked well for my needs. SD card reader has gone out, so I\\'m not as happy as I\\'d like to be. Manufacturer says to do a factory reset to try to restore functionality before shipping it back while under warranty. I\\'ll have to find some time to be willing to lose everything and try that before the warranty is up. Love it. I love this phone! I have had it for 3 months now. The Battery life is awesome: I sometimes go for 2 or 3 days between charges (but then I am not using it to play music or video.) The cameras work great, I love being able to \"tab\" between apps, rather than having to close one and open another like on all my previous phones. The price is also excellent. My husband plans to get one of these soon, too. I would definitely recommend this phone is okay Excellent! I like it some what but it comes with very little operating instructions so some things are hard to figure out. You have to down load the 108 page instruction manual.Recently I have found that the battery life doesn\\'t hold for even 24 hrs not happy about that at allCan\\'t get the sound of receiving texts changed shows one sound does anotherI would look around before totally deciding on this one first.Its not bad depends what you want to do with it. The Blackberry itself works fine, but none of the applications i.e. facebook, twitter, and myspace, do not work on the phone. I realized that its not the apps, but the phone that has the issue. Since there\\'s no refunds from this buyer I\\'m out of luck. had speaker problems with this phone from day one! occasionally, the phone rings, but missed many important calls.function key was also problematic; tried to contact amazon and originator about return/exchange. but got no reply; not at all pleased I decided to buy a reconditioned Motorola Razor but wish I hadn\\'t:The phone came with a weak battery and when I replaced it with a good one it goes through it real fast and takes a long time to charge back up.When it\\'s flipped open it looks like it booting up and it goes to 3 different screens before settling on one.I can\\'t open text messages that contain photos. And after 2 weeks of use the hinge became weak which causes the phone to short out and drop the calls.I\\'m no expert but I\\'ve had 3 Razors (new ones), but this is a dud.--Cheers Please not: this phone is not Factory Unlocked, AT&T unlocked. \"Pink tree cammo\" wouldn\\'t normally be my first choice in color, but an OtterBox for $8.87? I\\'m fine with it. It actually matches a camp chair I have!I got this for my iPhone SE and it fits perfectly. You can\\'t use the \"thumb ID\" feature because there is a rubber \"plug\" over the \"thumb button,\" (which I think is there to \"protect\" the button from \"overuse issues\" -- I\\'ve encountered overuse of that button on an iPad so I assume there could be problems with the phones, too) but I\\'d rather have the button hold up than the thumb ID, so that\\'s not a problem. Never had a problem with this iphone. Worked great. Bought two. One works fine but other fails to find network properly. It worked perfectlyfor me! very Good Product, and good seller On my previous Nokia flip phone, I was used to seeing the battery gradually discharge and I knew when it was time to recharge. With this one.....battery symbol just goes red. When I took off the back of the phone to remove the battery so that I could install my SIM card, it was a real chore to get the back to \"click\" in. Other than that, a nice, little cellphone for the price. Also, it was a \"revelation\" to me that my SIM did not contain my contacts. Seems contact get saved to the phone, not the SIM card. I fired up my old phone (no SIM card needed) and was able to see all my contacts. it has very small screen,video quality isnt good.you can buy better phone with different brand in same price range.i never recomend this phone to anyone Good This phone dis not meet my expectations. I know that when u buy something used, you will have some minor problems. But with this phone, there are quite a few major problems. Truly I am not satisfied but I do not know the correct way to use my 30 day warranty. If someone can please contact me, it will be greatly appreciated! Excellent phone and great price. Thank you!!!! Excellent! BEST PHONE EVER!!! Took awhile to get here but still arrived within the designated time frame. Phone looks great and even came w a separate car charger and plastic case. HOWEVER, the phone did not come with a battery and I\\'m having trouble getting in touch w MAXTELL WIRELESS to rectify the situation. So i haven\\'t actually been able to use the phone yet. Excelent phone Does not come with the USB-adapter as other reviewers have mentioned. Comes in a plain box with the power cord and fast charger. The phone is flawless on the outside. The back of the phone says \"REFURBISHED BY ASURION\" etched into the metal, underneath the IMEI number. Excelente I didn\\'t like it Good..Thanks Nice phone camera quality is perfect tho is slow some times other than that I have no complains I love it!! What can i say about Otterbox that they don\\'t say about themselves? This is my second OBox. A couple weeks ago I get in the Labo, pissed fron a tough day on the market and smash the living crap outta my cellie. Needless to say, my phone lived to dial another day. My OBox? Not so llucky. This is my first Defender and hopefully my last OBox for awhile. I\\'m back to making millions. Or at least my phone looks like a million bucks. Excellent phone. after a few months, my daughter dropped her 5c and it broke. she said it was less than a foot, but then, this is the plastic case version...Anyway, i\\'m writing to say how pleased i am with nu2u, bc i took the phone to apple store, and after a 15-minute \"component verification\" the phone passed. truly their lable of \"brand new, in the box, full apple warranty\" was TRUE.Thanks Nu2u! I\\'m loving my new phone. I received it 3 business days after placing my order. An instructional step by step sheet was included which made set up with straight talk an absolute breeze!!! As instructed, a $6.99 one time net work fee was charged by straight talk. No problem. It took maybe 30 minutes for the straighttalk rep to talk me through simply because I speak \"redneck\" so I had to understand him. My phone came in it\\'s own box and everything is fine. The phone does everything I need it to do and yes, I recommend it and would definitely buy it again. Thanks!! this product is interesting and good product. good factory. this product help for complete anything. is important have this product Looks like new, the price is okay, a good BF purchase The product is almost new. it doesn\\'t have any issue. I love it. excellent Bought this for my daughter and she loves it. She had the Iphone 4 with a cracked screen and wanted to upgrade but on her new AT&T no contract plan, they wouldn\\'t give her the upgrade so we shopped around an dfound the best price here through a 3rd party seller. Arrived super fast in bew condition. The phone is very beautiful and works beautifully as well. It is a Dual SIM phone, but when you really put two SIM card (one micro SIM and one nano SIM) using the tiny, space limited side drawer, you cannot put a micro-SD card because they design to share the micro-SD card slot with the nano SIM card slot.For me, I really need to put 2 SIM, one for company, another for personal. So, putting 2 SIM and cannot get memory expansion for video & photo, and this short comes is not mentioned in the product description. If I know it before, I would buy BLU Studio One 4G. I only give it 3 star. I love this phone since I have had one for at least 4 years but the one I received was defective and sent it back Very great. I recommend it to anyone. indestructible Great, so far so good Excelente producto, es nuevo de paquete, vino con todos sus accesorios, cargador, audifonos, estuche. La bateria llego dañada. Por lo demas el telefono funciona muy bien con todas sus aplicaciones. Levanta 3g con digitel ya que vino desbloqueado con las bandas 3g 1,4,8. works great Not unlocked Very bad manufacturing, no signal most of time!!! Excellent cell phone It operates fine for normal use. But I used it for work to type report logs on and it was not working efficiently Excelente Glitches in software, I guess. Screen will sometimes jitter around. Screen not registering touches. The entire 7 row of keys unresponsive. All of this didn\\'t start to happen until had it for couple of months, so can\\'t return it. I took a chance on this phone and unfortunately I lost on this one. Fortunately only out $140 rather than a much larger amount. I bought 2 Black Berry 8520 and received one of them broken. So, since there is no warranty for being an international version, I have the most expensive Black Berry 8520 ever known. No one is responsible. I am ussually not very gentle with my cel phones.I do not plan to use it under water but I often use it with wet hands, under the rain or swetingTherefore, I ruin several cel phones.The option of an Active cel phone has allowed me to have a good (expensive) phone that will last me. DONT BUY IT!!!I bought 2 and had problems with both of them.Battery of both lasts only 4 hours. And in one of them i cant use 2g, 3g nor 4g when its supposed to work.(Im frrm Argentina). It\\'s an excellent seller I recomend a 100% I have had this phone for almost 2 weeks. I really like it except it has poor battery life. Also whenever I am playing a game the back of the phone where the battery is gets real hot. Other then the battery issue I am very pleased with it. My local ATT store was impressed on how fast it accepted the SIM card ( I had a micro SIM in my old phone which does not fit in this one). Picture quality is great. Sound is great. I\\'m truly enjoying all the features this phone offers. It disconnects with no warning and no reason. The phone can right beside of the watch and it will still disconnect It\\'s nice and fun Mine arrived with dead headphone jack port. Had to return to amazon for a refund. it nice Good phone hi Love it. Works well no problems with this phone and I like all the features. Recommended to some of my friends who have Samsung. Im sorry but the item I recieved was not the exact model. instead it is \"Xperia X compact\". nice phone and decent for the price, but service areas limited and this is not due to the provider Came without the pen, other than that was ok It works good for me but where can I get a new charging cable? I bought this for my little sister and she absolutely loves it! At first I was skeptical at how cheap the phone is. She been using the phone for a week now and so far no problem at all. The quality is pretty high for a cheap phone like this. The order arrived earlier than I expected it to be. Overall, This phone worth every single penny. I purchased this tiny phone to use for fitness apps (MapMyWalk & Fitbit), Kindle Reader app, Audible, & Overdrive, as well as using like an MP3 player. I use this device offline & over Wi-Fi only & do not have it set up for wireless phone service. Worked well with Dolphin browser for Vimeo videos also. Bluetoothed with TomTom fitness watch & Omron blood pressure monitor, but could not get it to work with the Fitbit Zip (Fitbit app, but it will use the Fitbit app to log a workout without a device).I have taken a few pics with the device. Picture quality is okay & does also record videos. It has a slot for additional memory, but I have not installed any in mine. If you plan on using for much storage, I recommend adding memory (think it\\'s a microSD slot, but check the specs).Pros: Love the size, pocket-size. Works great with Audible audiobooks & Overdrive audiobooks (from public library). Large speaker on backside great for audiobooks & music (must use with speaker face-up though). It was very easy to USB device to PC & copy music over. Has headphone jack. Comes with earbuds, USB charger, & USB cable.Cons: Need to use stylus for detailed clicking, not recommended for browsing. Getting the tip of charge cable in the right position is sometimes quirky. Bought this for my son, he loves it. good phone She loves the phone but it has a bad charger and I have yet to hear back from them and I\\'m not happy about it. This is the second boulder I\\'ve owned, and this does not live up to the previous one from Verizon.While this phone is rugged, the battery lasts for less than a day. I will try a new battery but it would have been nice if the one included had a little life.Also, there is a lot of lag. I wait a long time when selecting menu items or composing messages.Finally the speakerphone is barely audible unless you are in a silent room.All-in-all, I\\'m disappointed with this phone. It does not even come close to its predecessor. Este telefono esta por encima de lo basico pero pero claro le faltan muchas funciones como 3G. Sin embargo es un excelente telefono. Se le puede descargar muchas aplicaciones de la blackberry store. el trackball responde muy bien. Lo que si no me ha gustado es que no hace Zoom a las imagenes. Would not activate on Metro PCS Nice Arrived in condition as advertised. I did not have any problems with upgrade. Works and looks great. it\\'s great! I like it so much. It works really well and i feel that the price is reasonable too! This blackberry is the most perfect gift for my brother for this 50th birthday. It is a tad expensive but he \"LOVES\" owning one, so it is worth the money. For a couple of months, he was totally consumed with it, but he has come back down to earth now :) It is a classy \"toy\". I may get one for myself. I have been using the phone for around three weeks with no complaint so far. Exactly as described, functioned with Sprint as advertised, nothing hidden Good celphone. I should buy one with high store capacity The phone was lock could not be used returned it I purchased the phone about a month ago and to date have no regrets...strongly recommend it! Its value for money! Well, I have only had the phone less than a month so it is hard to rate it other than that it arrived intact and as advertised and is currently working well and up to expectations, but again it has only been one month on this Refurbished Samsung S5. So, ask me more about it in 3 to 6 months,but so far I am pleased with this well Refurbished S5. It looks nice as other phones, but the camera and the speaker have problems. When I talk on the ohone, I can hear the other side, but they can\\'t hear anyhting from me. And the camera gets frozen all the time and then automatically shut down. I have no idea how to fix them. Sucks. Paid a premium for what I thought was an organization that paid attention to their refurbishing. Plugged it in. Did not charge. I really like the graphics, the case sucks (lol), and the charging time of the battery drains really fast. Other than those few thigns so far Ilove the phone for the price. I purchased a Galaxy Prime Duos and it didn\\'t work well for me. I just want to know where I can order an extra battery. I love love those phones I love this phone Very fast shipping, and the phones are justo what i need. I thought inline staffs were fake b@ amazon with best mobile proved me wrong..cell works perfectly and ..gud job. Can never have anything bad to say about apple. Always reliable and does what I need It\\'s great... Phone arrived on time and as promised. I am completely satisfied and would purchase again. Thr amazing! not an original product. its a knock off. I got another phone just like this one at verizon store and realized the difference right away. It feels different this phone bends and cracks much more, and has minor visual differences. the biggest give away is that i noticed that there was a gap at the top of the phone and i could easily slide mi finger nail inside and lift up the screen.... This phone is everything i need. The quality of the picture is perfect i love it and everything there is about the phone Great smartphone. Blackberry OS very intuitive, robust terminal.But there is one drawback I ordered the \"Blackberry Z30 STA100-2\" and I received versions STA100-5 and LTE, unfortunately, does not work in my country (Poland). LOVE IT good service, recommended product Basically inserted SIM Card and my son took from there. Seems to be getting along with it just fine I brought this phone for my daughter and she loved it until she cracked the screen after only having it for a month. Overall it\\'s a great phone. I would recommend it to others. Works perfectly - great job! Nice phone! easy to program and easy to use. This item works as described but I have become accustomed to a more advanced user interface on a cell phone. my wife loved this! I was very satisfied with Amazon on the shipment and customer service. As far as the watch, I purchased it for my son to use with his iPhone 4s. also I like the fact that you could put a sim card in it and use it as a phone. unfortunately when you put a sim card in it it doesn\\'t accept any of the Services. also on the Apple system it doesn\\'t really do much with Bluetooth. if I was to do it all over again, I would have bought a Samsung gear. I have a gear 2 and it does everything expected to do. I read some reviews before buying the phone and I could have been discouraged from buying it. The main reason I bought was because I was broke and the phone i was using suddenly began to mess up. Someone said the battery was not very good and I serious usage I will say its a lie (suggestion turn off the battery percentage as it does not tell the truth sometimes). For $99 this phone is worth every penny. It\\'s not as fast as needed but hey I didn\\'t have to break the bank. One more thing when buying buy atleast a 16gb memory card with it ( you will need it) I am satisfied with my Motorola Razor Maxx. It is sleek and lightweight. Buen celular, todo excelente en cuanto a la funcion y compatibilidad, aca en Vzla funciona fino, lo unico malo es el fleje ya se daño y toco comprar de repuesto. Bought this for my girlfriend. She opted to get a new Iphone instead but for the price, this phone does what I need it to do. Finding accessories isn\\'t quite as easy as it is for the Samsung Galaxy but I won\\'t complain. The product is not what I expected, I thought it was GSM and CDMA turns out that is, the information poublicada not say that type of technology or Connect using the apparatus, reasoned that it was late to me by problems at customs, I could not contact the seller. Not only was the phone a great price but even more than that was the person that sold it to me. I will never forget her kindness and caring. Probably one of the best experiences I have ever had on any online store Was extremely surprised how new it looked for a refurbished product. Saved tons of money. Doesn\\'t include earpods, but still a great deal! watch all in all is fine i cant access my txt msg threw bluetooth the headphones broke after first use theres a bit of a delay and the wall unit for me to plug in my usb cord was not in the box sim card was not in the box Very good phone. I LOVE all of my apple products and I love this phone! I have a lot of experience with apple though, so it is easy for me to run it. Awesome piece of kit It\\'s good for the price. I love it but only problem wit charge so I went to Apple Store for replace new battery. There me go wit beautiful iPhone but not a bad on scatch.. Thk y so still working all the way Excellent. I absolutely love this phone. The packaging was nice, It arrived on time and the new features are amazing. I was somewhat indecisive of whether i should purchase the iphone 6 or the note 5 nonetheless, i am happy with the choice I made Great phone just doesn\\'t work with many carriers. Love my phone.....but it is huge!!!! THIS PHONE IS NO LONGER WORKING!!!!! PUT IT ON THE CHARGER OVERNIGHT THEN WENT TO TURN IT ON THE NEXT MORNING BUT GOT NOTHING BUT A WHITE SCREEN! DIDN\\'T EVEN LAST 2 MONTHS AND IT CANNOT BE RETURNED...WHAT A JOKE. NEEDLESS TO SAY I\\'M HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED AND CANNOT JUST RUN OUT A BUY ANOTHER SMART PHONE THAT FITS MY NEEDS.THE PHONE WAS NOT DROPPED OR DAMAGED...SHAME ON YOU AMAZON! I recently bought a new Lumia 920 and it is stunning. Battery life is phenomenal (I use it mainly for sending emails, texting, some web browsing). The other day, I didn\\'t have to charge it for almost 2 days!! Screen looks amazing, love that I can sync it with my other windows 8 devices. All in all, WELL worth the money. I\\'ve had my phone for several months and am really happy with it. I will buy my next phone from Amazon! LOVE IT Phone worked very well for the first month. Now it is very very slow. I am very happy with this phone. It is responsive a and has a great camera. This phone is awesome I love it. It came on time, and was just what I was looking for. What I would suggest is sending the sim card with it though. I purchased this phone for my daughter, last November because her old cell phone was acting up. It worked fine until mid-May and the touch screen stopped working.Sent e-mail through Amazon on May 14 to Masterdeals what was the way to get warranty service, its been one week and no reply. Not an acknowledgement, nothing.What sets apart real customer service is how they treat the customer after the sale. I will not be buying from Masterdeals again! I don\\'t like having to connect to a phone in order to use this item. Without the phone it is just a watch. But i guess for the price it\\'s an ok watch. I bought that for somebody else so I don\\'t use it on a daily basis Love love love my iPhone 6 Can make calls and send texts, also has an excellent FM radio. Not quite the shade of blue I was expecting, but bright enough that I never loose it because it blends into a counter. Good deal for its price, I would say, though very few tone or profile options. The phone doesnt work with my AT&T Sim Card :( perfect I want to return my recent note 3 phone,just because is not working good for me,l can\\'t listening to my voice mail sometime Internet don\\'t work. good very good You will find other details about how wonderful this cell is. I agree. The battery life is great, last 2 days for me with average use, mostly connected to WiFi and less 4G. Really fast, not to heavy at all. Got this 32gb version and added a 64gb microsd. Enough. And have 2 sim card (of course, only one of them with 4G online). Two things that I HATE from this Asus cellphone--- FIRST: very bad native original app for watching media; just download and app to replace it and done. But (and I love this from Samsung and Motorola) when you are watching media or worst, you give your cell to your child with a video, if you block the player (in order to prevent the exit from the video..) oops! if you touch any of the menu bottoms, you will stop the app and with the child, worst, will exit and go back to the cell menu or the main screen. You wont have this problem with Samsung or Moto, because when you block the cell while watching a video, those bottoms are kind or disable. And the SECOND THING THAT I HATE.... the ON/OFF Power Bottom is too sensitive, you will find your cellphone rebooting beacuse you didnt notice that pushed it inside your pocket. This sensitive is worst with the case I bought: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013HJ2NC8/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_6 Excellent smartphone I bought to my wife and she loves it Excellent phone! Very disappointed and feeling ripped off. I always loved Samsung, I had this phone for not even 3 months. When I received the phone one side of the screen was raised, the glass wasn\\'t fully in the frame of the S5. Then about 2 months later the power button went, it glitches. I never ever damaged it. I never dropped it, I\\'m very careful with phones..Don\\'t waist your money I have purposely waited a while to write a review for this product. Simply because I wanted to be sure it was perfect.. and it is! I was a Note 2 user before purchasing this one. Both I purchased through Amazon and both were the International Factory Unlocked models. If you travel at all then this is what you will want. It is so simple to pop in a SIM from whichever country you are going to be in and you are in business.I use line2.com services and so I do not need celllar service, just DATA and so using a SIM card for an ipad works perfectly for me.As for the phone... it is FAST, Lightweight and so beautiful to look at. I love the feel of it in my hand as it is not slippery at all (compared to my friend\\'s iphone6) I use a very thin rubber cover that covers the back of it when I am out but always take it off when I am home as I love the feel of just the phone in my hand.. truly the king of the Samsung lineup of phones. Worth every $ in my opinion. First one came and was defective the camera would malfunction and the UI would constantly crash and bug out, Replacement was sent next day got it on the Metro PCS Network and No complaints amazing phone for the price! Blu Is really stepping it up! I\\'d say It\\'s just as good and better then some Flagships in 2016! OK Phone... Wife had a hard time using the device. Kept dropping calls. Well that was interesting! I took it to Verizon and they said it could not be used for a Verizon phone. Hmmm... Good paper weight?Works with Wi-Fi device but not as a phone. Phone doesn\\'t play sounds or ring total scam My order was for an unlocked HTC, I have no usr for yjis phone.How can I return for an unlocked one??Maximo BoschBuenos Aires, Argentina Excellent phone; lots of memory, crisp display, great camera and a very good value! The phone works great with my T-Mobile carrier. Only one problem- no matter how I set the date/time, it defaults back to 6/2/2011 and the time is 2 minutes short of the actual time. I\\'ve even pulled the batter and used the reset all function, but no luck. Any suggestions? I love this phone..for $200 it\\'s worth it.The display is great. The screen is bright and sharp.Sound is great. But sound low while your driving..My music sounds great too.I love the selfies cam especially the flash... But not so much the back cam..it looks a little funny but it\\'s OK..I love all the security features. I got the phone basically for the fingerprint scanner. I don\\'t use any of the other features because I\\'m scared illegal forget a password or something but if your into the tech stuff it\\'s awesome. Plus a picture vault..It\\'s thin and light weight.at first I was disappointed about the size but the more I played with it the better it felt in my hand and now the size is perfect.The 1st few days or so I had the phone I wasn\\'t using it much and the battery lasted about 2 days with very light use. Today I\\'ve used the phone for about 4hours and I\\'m at 61% (social media and Pandora usage).. I may end up buying a battery pack for a back up.The phone speed is very fast. I love it..I\\'m having issues with apps and location because the phone is very sensitive.. but the GPS does work very well and even tell you your route to work when it\\'s time for you to go..Overall great phone and I\\'d buy again.I\\'m also with straight talk wireless and live in a wooded area. The phone works great.. Phone is everything that is reported to be. Very happy with it. My only complaint and it\\'s more of annoyance is the double tap on and off. Unless you tap the exact spot it doesn\\'t turn on. Great tool for classroom teachers. But Apple needs to address ios update issues with their cameras and flashes. My first two used iPhone 5Ss looked great but had inoperable cameras! Sellers were great and quickly refunded money. Research showed thousands of 5s users have camera issues after updating their operating system. So, I\\'m not updating anytime soon until this is publicly addressed by Apple. Until then, I love my current 5s. The phone which sold me does not work on the LTE network. You publish the networks with which operates the phone but he who sent me is not published .I think a lack of respect. Unfortunately I am in Venezuela and when I got the phone was very disappointed because it is not the one I bought .I wondered this because the first thing I saw was bought efore reputation. Well I was wrong.Thank you....... I purchased 2 of these, they arrived in 2 days! One is working perfect, one had a bad battery and had to be returned. They had my refund processed the same day! I will be ordering another one soon very responsable... great product Good phone watchband broke for using few days Thanks This is a great little phone. Weighs under 2 oz on my postal scale. One star off for the recessed charging port that others have mentioned (had to take a utility knife to the case). Going back to Kitkat is a bit weird, but everything works great. I got this as a second phone to take running without weighing me down. Switching sim cards takes a bit, but not too bad. Too small for me to use as an everyday phone. Would buy this brand again. All in all a great deal. The screen half of this slider phone was taped from the inside to the main part of the phone. Not only did it fall completely apart within days, but the screen went white and the phone quit working altogether, (Of course it couldn\\'t work, as it could not attach to the main part of the phone!) This is the worst experience I\\'ve ever had with a product I ordered from Amazon. I certainly hope I get my money back quickly, so I can buy a decent phone. Cute!!! ;) I have had this phone for over 6 months and it works great. I am not a person who does everything on their phone, but I can get my email, messages, etc. I have ran some google play apps and have not found anything that has not worked on it so far. It is a great starter Smartphone for someone who wants a good basic smartphone that is not expensive. Best bang for the buck I have found in a long time. It was great. No problems, just as advertised. CONFORME CON LA COMPRA, ERA LO Q ESPERABA CON RESPECTO AL ENVIO Y TIEMPOS DE ENTREGA TODO EXCELENTE MUCGAS GRACIAS. ESPERO SEGUIR TENIENDO BUENAS EXPERIENCIAS CON USTEDES Nice phone, good price. It really helps. If you\\'re familiar with any of these lumia\\'s they are all virtually the same. Purchased refurbished from Redman, WORKED PERFECT. Activated today on Sprint, without a hitch! The customer service rep said, \"where did you get this phone? \" He could not believe it when I told him the price, it looked brand NEW! These phones work awesome on Sprint, or Flashed on Page Plus. great product This item would have been great if i had received it but i didn\\'t. Empty box with all the accessory. The company was kind enough to reimburse me. If you wan to buy this phone then go ahead but be cautious Best phone ever 100% recommended seller , excellent products and full responsibility , five star , excellent quality. bien I got this phone because it gives me a wifi spot without having to pay my prepaid unlimited carrier extra.THANKS BLU.If it had NCR I would have to implant this in my body. This is a great phone for the price! Just keep that in mind!Does a lot of everything, But the only thing really negative is that it can hold a 100% charge for not even 12 hrs. & can get hot! I love everything about this phone. I purchased this to replace my Samsung S3 after I dropped it. The S3 is the size of the display screen on the J7 so I\\'m still adjusting to the larger size phone. The phone I received is exactly as described - dual SIM slots and a memory card slot. I purchased this in gold and the color is exactly as shown on Amazon. The phone is unlocked and works perfectly in the Bahamas and I had no issues setting it up. I received a brand new phone in a sealed box 2 days after ordering it on Prime. The seller also sent an email offering any support that may be needed. I would definitely recommend this phone. The phone works but unfortunately Bluetooth does not and the battery life is a bit short. for an iPhone it was decently priced and it is fine for my purposes as a back up phone. I just wish the Bluetooth worked!!! :-(Update: The battery no longer works and hasn\\'t in months so I this was a waste of money. I guess I should have been more concerned with the limited battery life when I first got the phone and returned it then. Oh well it is an expensive lesson learned. Excelente Great new Phone. love it im excited I just ordered and now I just gotta be patient I hope its good The quick charge capability does work after some time and after using it for about 2 month or less the battery quality has decreased significantly..... It takes very long to charge and dies within a couple of minutes I love this samsung galaxy s5 really everythingIs Fine & nothing problem, even the price is fair. Excelente!! Excellent ,too early to review I had no problems with the seller. It worked for my Kitty Wireless cellular service! Awesome phone fast processor. But for this Verizon or Sprint users this phone is not compatible for those providers. Attractive light weight case that protects the phone well. That for lady\\'s who like taking nudes late at night My daughter loves this phone. Camera is awesome! For like a month I looked for a \"dumbphone\" to replace my \"smartphone\". I wanted to save money for more important things so I decided to ditch my 30 dollar required data plan........and I found this.Wow, this phone I awesome. It looks sleek and modern, and It has some of the functions that a \"smartphone\" would have. It worked with AT&T here in the US with a simple SIM card switch. I love the qwerty keyboard and I am overall very happy with all the phone has to offer, except for the 2 megapoixel camera. I would be willing to pay more if the camera was like, 5 megapixels.This is the best \"dumbphone\" out there. Not many US retailers will offer Nokia phones because Nokia has not cashed in on the \"smartphone\" with data plan scheme. Good Job Nokia. For some odd reason, I am unable to send picture messages. I can send FB, Messenger, ect. just not in a text..otherwise, I love it! good phone I like it, but this price is a little expensive. Came as claimed. Near flawless condition... I couldn\\'t find anything wrong with it if I tried. Only thing is it came with a black back piece of aluminum... No apple logo or and writing, at all. But it grew on me its very sleek. Phone operates as expected and is lightning fast. I would suggest to anyone. i got so excited getting this phone just to find out within minutes of getting it, it can not charge at all i was in NEED of a phone so i just saw all the good reviews i will never buy from these people EVER again. Excelent I love the phone and it came in early, but there are concerns. My phone upon the first boot up did not ask me to set the settings, and the language was already in Taiwan Chinese. There are also two stickers on the back of the phone which left some glue on the phone that was difficult to get rid of. So far I have not found any defect on it or anything missing, but it still bothers me a little bit that the phone was not completely in factory format mode. Pros: It\\'s super fast, has a fingerprint scanner, takes an external sd card, can take your pulse, has a beautiful display, and was easy to set upCons: The menu buttons do different things than previous models which is still throwing me off, the auto brightness is way too dark in a dark room, there\\'s still some bloatware that can\\'t be disabled, and the ability to restrict app permissions was removedOverall I believe this was a great deal! Loved it. Got here on time and it\\'s everything I expected. Thank you It OK for watching videos and things like that but it sucks there\\'s no flash and the camera quality is garbage. This sleek little bugger was a snap to activate--all I did was pop in my current SIM card I was using with an unlocked Moto Q, power this baby up and in 2 minutes was sending and receiving calls and texts. (yeah I did charge it to 100% first.) I registered this thing at Samsung\\'s web site and was shocked to see it only left the factory line 9 days before it was shipped! These arent some warehouse clearance specials, they are brand-new.I tested the 4G where it was available, and it was darn close to 2MBps, faster than my home DSL. I upped my TMobile plan and am looking forward to trying the wireless hotspot. There was no advertising or announcement that TMobile was rolling out 4G here in Central Florida. It works a lot of the main areas, not out in the boonies where I live...Great phone, Android Gingerbread waaaaay faster than Froyo...camera takes great pics, the built-in media player is nice w headphones. Could have come with a better ringtone and wallpaper assortment. The Google Maps GPS gets me in my yard to about a foot of real-life. Sweet.The included data cable didn\\'t allow it to self-install drivers in Windows 7 64-bit, so I downloaded the Samsung New PC Studio (yeah that\\'s what they call it) and then was able to browse the phone and add stuff to my SD card. I got a 32GB one somewhere at 32 bucks...so now I got me a touch-screen Gingerbread MP3 player..that has a 4G phone built in!! for like 170 bucks less than the 32BG IPod. Can\\'t beat that with a stick.One Week UPDATE....okay, it\\'s been a week...the battery last pretty well if u keep a shortcut to Task Manager on the 1 home screen and shut stuff down when you\\'re done. The 4G speed is incredible when you have a good 4G signal (6MBps download at speedtest.net). The hotspot is a cinch to set up...I helped friends on Boost with the Galaxy Prevail..while that\\'s a bang for the buck (was on sale at B.B. for 75...they look at mine and say I WANT DAT.. The phone was in a good condition and seemed to be brand new. My brother-in-law is using the phone and is very happy on receiving it because he has been waiting 4 this phone ever since his old nokia 5800 xpressmusic broke down. Thank you Amazon.com and CLC Wholesale for delivering the phone on time. Nice product @ a nice price. I was highly recommend this product as it truly an innovative device to own. Excellent goods It is quite difficult to take off the back cover of the phone to put in the sim card/memory card and importantly the battery. Otherwise it is a perfect match for my 64 year old grandmother. I recommend this product. I love the speed, it\\'s awesome the cell not turn, what connect appears that load turns off, i said to be batery bad wonderful product one of my all time favorite phones and trust me ive had quite a few !!! if you are the type of person who enjoys having a keyboard as well as the touch option i think you\\'ll like this one. PERFECTO This watch is cool. For the price, it is worth every penny. It is hooked to everything in my phone. Although i could not figure out the browser. I dont think they even made it to work. Instead of looking up BT notification apps in the play store, wait until your watch arrives and turn it on. Scroll through and you will see an app QT. Scan it and the app works flawlessly. I can connect to my phone from the watch with this app. All the other apps never worked so don\\'t waste your time. As for the looks, it is amazing. Not too bulky or uncomfortable. Sleek and the touchscreen works great. Great product, fast shipping, great deal and excellent customer service. thanks. Garbage Bought 3 mobile for my siblings. After 2 months, mobile didn\\'t turn on. Don\\'t buy this product and also not from this seller. PHONE HAS GREAT FEATURES AND IS EASY TO USE . FOR SOMEONE THAT DOES NOT NEED OR WANT A SMARTPHONE . THIS PHONE IS A GREAT PHONE TO HAVE . the phone works very well in Venezuela, it\\'s original package, I recommend great phone and transaction i loved the phone for 4 months then it just cut of and never truned back on... it didn\\'t have a virus, fell in water or on the floor nothing like that..this happened to a number of people so i would not advise getting any LG phone its not reliable... I bought this to replace my husband\\'s blackberry storm he lost in the airport. He is so please with it\\'s sleek design. He likes it a lot. So easy to use and surf the web too. A perfect little thing specially for a busy, always-on-the-go and not gadget freak person like him. This is our 2nd iPhone 5 from this seller. The first phone came with almost no battery life, but was pleasantly returned & replaced. The replacement phone has more limited battery life than I would like, but not nearly as bad as the original. Couldn\\'t update This phone can run very hot when charging. Can be a bit dangerous. Other than that, it\\'s a great Android phone. Very stylish and slim Worked for about a week and then the tower signal started fading and disconnecting completely. 2g networks are supposed to become retired and its causing network problems. I was never able to run data trough phone. The positive is a trial on smart watch usage. When it works, it is great. Bluetooth signal is weak and gets lost too easily though. I am very pleased with my phone because all my expectations were fulfilled, it\\'s a very good phone and I recommend it highly. She loves it like a newborn baby I recommend them are excellent and timely, and the phone came to me in perfect condition with all accessories and was super fast, thank you from Venezuela This is actually the second time I have purchased this device. My father lost his first one and I purchased this one again. My father has dementia and is very comfortable using this device! What I like about it for him is the keypad is big- so it\\'s great for his eye sight. It\\'s basic and easy to navigate throughout the phone and the speaker is loud on the phone as well. EXCELENTE...... Works as intended with no issues. What a Phone. Did a TON of research to choose between the Galaxy Note 5, Galaxy S6 Edge Plus, LG V10, and this phone. I was looking for an Android phablet that could work on both US (AT&T) and China (China Mobile) 4G. 4G knocked the LG V10 out. Price and design knocked the S6 Edge Plus out. When it came down to the Note 5 and the Nexus 6P, I did a lot of reading and it basically came down to camera and novelty. From all of the comparisons I\\'ve read, both have amazing cameras and the 6P has definitely proven itself to me. Coming from a Galaxy S4, the novelty of the 6P won out. The note 5 would have been more of the same. In my opinion, the fingerprint reader location and camera on the 6P beat the Note 5. Speaking of the fingerprint reader, I never thought I\\'d want to lock my phone. It\\'s so easy though and works consistently well, that I\\'ve decided to use it. The only time it falters is with wet hands, but there\\'s always the pin for backup. The 6P\\'s regular operating system and security updates are a plus too. Having a Huawei phone for my time in China is another bonus. I can confirm the following: the H1512 international nexus 6P works well on both US AT&T 4G and China China Mobile 4G. The phone is super snappy. Who cares that there\\'s not a \\'clear all\\' apps button, this phone knows how to do memory management, you\\'ll never have a need to manually clear an app from memory. The phone is also beautiful to look at with its AMOLED screen, and takes gorgeous still shots. I\\'ve already had a friend (who owns an S6) request that my phone be the one taking the group picture. Despite not having optical image stabilization, the electronic image stabilization does a great job with videos. I was a little scared jumping into the phablet arena, but it hasn\\'t been a problem in the least. Even fits into my skinnier jeans. Is a real slim phone with a nice feel, I\\'d recommend the slimmest fitting spigen case, keeps the phone sexy while also keeping the glass off of surfaces and makes it easier to hold (it\\'s too slim without a case). The 3450 mah battery lasts a long long long long time. I rarely end a day below 30% battery, and I\\'m often around 50+%. Fast charging is a godsend though most all new phones offer the same.Want me to pick a negative? It\\'s panoramas; they\\'re not great. Have yet to take one that doesn\\'t have some odd clipping or shape, and some are just downright bad. Maybe panoramas on this phone work differently from phones I\\'ve had in the past and I just haven\\'t figured it out.Couldn\\'t be happier. I hope this phone lasts me a long long time. Congrats to Huawei on making Google\\'s first flagship quality nexus, now if only China would unblock google.... Would be nice if Amazon sold the 64GB version too. Handy little thing. Haven\\'t tried it internationally yet, but it looks great. A little slow on heavier apps and keyboard is a little small. Makes a great backup travel phone, or a handy little MP3 player. Earpiece speaker died after receiving. Totally died after using 32 days. However, shipping is fast and response takes one day. just couldn\\'t be happier with product as advertized The phone did not come in an original tmobile box, but new. I initially had trouble setting up the password on the phone and went to tmobile to get it reset. Other than that, the phone worked like it should. Works really well .my husband said best Father\\'s Day gift. Works awesome so far! Excelent and perfect Phone was missing the USB cable. I didn\\'t realize it until I got it home. The phone itself was fine. Not much to say that hasnt been said many times over about this phone, but there is one factual error as it relates (only in the US) to the phone\\'s description on compatibility with phone service providers. This phone does in fact work with CRICKET (as cricket is a GSM MVNO utilizing ATT\\'s GSM network).I myself am using it with cricket and have both the g925f and the ATT s6 edge and there is no noticable difference in mobile connection performance. The only thing to note is that with this phone, you must set the APN settings appropriately. The ATT S6 Edge automatically detects and sets APN. It was great! Brand new! No problems.... My husband brags about this phone all the time. Glad he\\'s happy. Honestly, this phone will work as a backup but the lack of RAM makes it too slow to be useful for anything other than phone calls. Even checking email is a cumbersome, frustrating event best left for when you get home and can use a tablet... or a laptop... or a desktop... or your TV remote... or virtually anything other than this device.On the plus side, I spent a lot less time on my phone while trying to use this device. I found myself stopping to smell the flowers, engaging in conversation with random people I didn\\'t even know (who I apparently work with) and even developed a taste for foreign cuisine as a result of getting irrevocably lost without google maps to guide me. I would be thankful save for almost losing my job when the time on the phone randomly changed to Greenwich mean and the alarm failed to go off... while I was on the road... irrevocably lost...In reference to other reviews -No, you cannot use the SD card for appsThis phone is capable of HSPA+The screen on time is short enough to not be worth the effort to test. s*** phone it get get frezzeed for no reseon phone works good great sound best with blue tooth although the stylist broke 2 days after i received it other then that get what you pay for price was right ... Great condition, looks and works like brand new is also stop during you are using you have to turn off and them on to work again I like the unit so far. I\\'ve had it for about a month and some and it has been doing well. The antenna could do with a signal boost it tends to drop off when in certain places, more than other brands. I am also concerned with the fact that the phone screen can only be activated by the power button. A redundancy built in should have been considered. Overall its a good buy for the price phone. No this didn\\'t work at all for me had to give it to a friend. Great phone for the price.. Big too.. Very NIce, fast and easy to use. Better design and materials than galaxy S 4. Seems stronger than competition. Also wet and dust resistance. Excelent serves its function, terrible sound quality through speaker. i think mine blew out or something. everything else works great. other than the quality control issue with the speaker, i have yet to contact blue about.. i have been using this phone for about 3 months. its decently fast, apps work great. would get 5 stars if call speaker didn\\'t blow out in the first week. question is would i buy it again? probably not. currently shopping for an lg or htc...Update- Contacted Blu via email. waiting for reply 5/17. Customer service so far is very impersonal. was really happy with the phone and then a month after warranty was up the camera quit and and hour later the screen quit. Never buying a phone from here or online again. Reached Hgffghhhhhhhhjjffffghgasfgghjjj Price worth the living excelente The phone came relatively quickly and has been working great this far (3months)However the cord that came with it doesn\\'t work any longer and I will need to go buy one, also never came with an adapter so that was an additional expense. other than that my daughter loves her phone and I think I want one too! Problem whith the Iphone, and Problem geting my money back !!!!!! Good Nice phone. Very sleek and nice and fast. Definitely an upgrade from my S3. And I love the size. I highly recommend it although options for cases right now are pretty limited as it is not the most popular phone on the market. The product was in near perfect condition at an amazing price. Thank you! This phone is a great buy; perfect for someone needing a smart phone but doesn\\'t have alot of money worked well for a while. stopped working after a few weeks. Excellent, it is recommended to the community. Lucky for future operations. So far, pretty good. Only time will tell, but it\\'s a great phone. I had the Nexus 5, so the 5x was a logical step up. I couldn\\'t get the transfer of apps to work during initialization. That\\'s the only complaint so far. The screen and camera are excellent. The battery life seems much better than on my old Nexus. amazing phone I wanted to wait roughly 3 weeks to provide an accurate review of this cell phone. First, I love the Note 5 and have always been a fan of the Note series. However, I am not sure if this phone was a manufacture or seller refurbished phone giving that I did not want a refurbished phone. My proclamation of the phone possibly being refurbished is due to the fact that oftentimes the window usually the text message window would somewhat refresh itself (Hard to describe, but the best way would be to imagine if you click the refresh button on a website on your computer and the screen will go transiently go blank then pop back up. That is what happens with the text messaging sometimes). Also, the actually text keyboard randomly closes sometimes. Not sure if it is a touch screen problem or digitizer problem, but it is sometimes annoying. The headphones that were sent with the phone were damaged and didn\\'t work properly. Great cell phone. Takes really good pictures. I like. Very much. I got excellent phone. sealed not broken. New phone. And perfect unlocked phone. Thank you. Seller. Very good It\\'s Very good, working very well. I have had it for a short time but performing very well. Would recommend Just as advertised! Sometimes it seems like the only cell phones out there are $600 iPhones or $550 Samsung Galaxies. Surely there are good phones out there at reasonable prices. Well, this Blu is one of them. I\\'ve had this one for a month now. To begin with, it\\'s a little bigger than I thought it would be. The screen is super crisp, sharp and hi-res. Videos look great on it. Next it has plenty of memory so loading a ton of apps is no problem. Performance is very good - switching between apps is quick and all my apps are running great. Connecting to T-Mobile was a breeze. Music is streaming through my LG Bluetooth headphones flawlessly. Google Maps and the GPS got me to my destination just fine. The FM radio is cool to have. One negative is the camera is not so great in some lighting conditions. In daylight it\\'s great, at night - not so much. And this is really nit-picking, but I like to use the volume controls as a shutter button, most phones let you do this, but not this one. I should be able to find an app for that.So in summary, this is a very solid, very capable phone at a great price for the price the product is not bad but if my phone is in my pants pocket i sometimes lose connection. i have yet to understand the pace count and why i cannot convert it to miles or why the product software that i downloaded to my phone doesn\\'t convert or sync either. Again, for the price it aint that bad. My rating is price dependent. I\\'ve been an iPhone user since the iPhone 3 came out. I updated to an iPhone 6 last year and have been pleased with the larger size . We just retired and another spendy phone for my wife\\'s old eyes isn\\'t in the budget. She got the 6 and I got the Blu. Only had it for 3 days and I am amazed at the quality for $89 . It has a beautiful screen and a very solid feeling. It has no LTE , so big data users wouldn\\'t be happy . I\\'ve been seeing about 4 Mbps download speeds with Cricket which is plenty for me. If I get a year out of the phone at this price then all is good. I chose this phone because of it\\'s smaller, more portable size, and it has worked perfectly so far. It has many new, up to date features with the same reliability as any other android. Shipping was fast and efficient, and the box comes with everything you need to get started. This is a great phone from a great company, and I would recommend it to anyone! I received the phone today. Its actually for my girlfriend and right away she loved it. From what I see the phone is awesome, maybe even better than my Galaxy Mega 2! So far so good!Great buy, prompt delivery. I LOVE Amazon!! I received my phone and in no time had it set up I\\'ll be adding a 2nd SIM card soon and will be fully utilizing all of the features this phone has to offer. Love my new Polaroid A6! This Iphone product didn\\'t meet my expectations at all. There were many damages around the phone casing, and the main speaker, on the front screen, wasn\\'t working properly. Also the phone over-heats; not to mention the battery life drains faster than usual. Unfortunately my experience was bad, yes the phone was delivered on time, and visually everything was ok. But when I tried to connect to my home WiFi I noticed that it didnt work, I tried everything but nothing. Since I was naive enough to by this phone without an international warranty (I live in Venezuela), trusting other reviews now Im stuck with this phone and I had to send it to a technician on my expense to see if he can fix it.Bottom line, don\\'t buy phones that dont have warranty, I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER, WHY NO WARRANTY? VERY FISHY.Back to my faithful IPHONE!Oh! And I wrote to this seller to seek help and they never wrote back. I GOT A VERY BAD DEAL.VENEZUELAN BUYERS I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS SELLER AT ALL. I have the phone two weeks now and has met my expectations great phone. touch screen too sensitive - when held to ear, hits keys continually. Would not purchase again, because also end up hanging up on people if head cheek touches the correct button. Just what I wanted......excellent features. loved it... I HATED IT & RETURNED IT Because...Poor voice reception on T-Mobile in metro Orlando; non-adjustable crippled ascending ring; NO CAMERA FLASH; NO AUTO-FOCUS CAMERA; short battery life; not a good value even for a starter phone at this price point.Motorola designed this feature-crippled cheapie cell phone for emerging markets like India and that\\'s where it should stay...NOT really appropriate for the U.S. market. It took a few calls to get this thing fully functional with our net 10 service and the sim card from my wifes old phone only partially worked after being cut to fit this phone. I had to order a new micro sim card from amazon for .99 and now its working great. My understanding is that this problem is unique to net 10 sim cards as they become married to the phone they come in. After overcoming this minor annoyance and the short wait for the new sim we are very happy with this phone and highly recommend it. Amazing product! Cams early! its cool cell only lasted five months , plate damaged This was a gift for my son. He really likes the phone and keeps it close by all the time. Love my new phone! Works great, I don\\'t think I am even using all of the features it has. Great phone would recommend to anyone. Didn\\'t like phone or seller. Great phone Awesome stuff. Phone is great condition. Fast shipping.Thank you. I\\'m not much of a reviewer...Highly reccommed people. My order came extremely fast! Everything was perfect as described and works just great! I highly recommend buying from this seller The item in question was not an issue but the programs installed where, I couldn\\'t get it to accept my messages and it had to install apps that I could figure out what they did. Hard to transition from an iPhone but after two weeks. Really like the galaxy Yes but now I gave it to my granddaughter as I traded it in for the 6! A wonderful phone, works perfectly.Fast shipment. $68，a little expensive. and the word is very little. windows 8 is not convinient. The serviso is bad, there is absent loader, earphone, CD, original Manual, card of 2 GB, the secondhand battery, the box was adulterated I bought this phone in November 8, 2015, but I have been having problems with my carrier because it wants a receipt where I support the imei I have, I need help with this, it it possible? my cellphone works perfectly I do not have any problem with it but I need that information quickly, thank you. WOW! I could not believe I got a used iPhone 5 with not a single scratch !! It\\'s in New condition and came with the wall charger plus a case matching the color. I honestly couldn\\'t believe what spectacular shape it was in and not expensive for and iPhone 5 at all! Shipped in 2 days and in excellent working condition, I swear it has to be new !!! 110% satisfied customer right here !! This phone claims to be unlocked. DO NOT BELIEVE IT. THIS PHONE IS NOT UNLOCKED. I inserted my Verizon sim card and it wold not work. I went online for assistance to switch the lines and they could not figure it out. I called Verizon and they could not figure it out and finally took it to a Verizon store where they told me it was not Verizon compatible. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Perfect! It got here sooner than expected and it has been really amazing!!!! Awesome I\\'m not sure how I bought this phone for $350 with 64 gigabytes of internal memory but I did ........and it works perfectly on Verizon Wireless.....can\\'t beat it........ came in great condition.....WIFE loves it. Love it great phone and it was shipped on time and the phone is in great condition as promised. Never liked iPhones but now I love them. Very happy with purchase! Fine Have no problems The product are awesome, I have not used them yet. Arrived early .. only took 3 days.. perfect.. only needed to charge an down load update 1 1/2 hrs later she\\'s one of my favorite things I\\'ve had this phone for about a week and I absolutely love it. It has the best specs of any phone on the market, and noticeably so! I put the device to work to see what it was really capable of; opened a ridiculous amount of apps, streaming video, etc. It did not hesitate one bit. Opened and ran everything smoothly, unlike any phone I\\'ve ever seen. And it doesn\\'t even cost half of what the new phone market leaders are selling their latest product for! Do not underestimate this phone because of its affordable price, it is simply amazing and I would recommend over and over again. Love the phone I have three of these, and they are great phones.I bought another, and did not get what is advertised. Most other buyers don\\'t, either. The phone listed is a \\'US Version with Warranty.\\' Many (most/all?) of what is being shipped are not US phones. The problem with that is that Nokia\\'s one year limited US warranty applies only to US phones. You may not know this until you try to get warranty repair service, as other reviewers here have noted. But a call to Nokia with the IEMI number will tell whether you have a US phone or not.Amazon is aware that shipped phones routinely don\\'t match the description, and won\\'t do anything about it. So do your homework and don\\'t be deceived. If a factory warranty is important to you, this is an unreliable source. Really low quality build, dont fit and wrong product, because the seller (Wirester) intentionally send the wrong item without my approval.When i asked \"Why you send me the wrong item?\", Wirester said the one i ordered was out of stock, so they send a different product.I know It\\'s only $5 phone case, but the way they do business is not right.The phone case i receive totally different graphic then the one displayed. Also the phone case cant close completely.It seems its a bit too small or not tall enough by a bit. So one end always open up cant be closed or clamped completely.I gave them 2 star, because they told me to return it and they cover the shipping. The cellphone overheats a lot specially when playing games i had to remove the sillicon protector and still heat goes up to 50cº, other than that everything else its OK.Battery life its good 24hrs for light use although gmaps consumes a lot, recommend desabling GPS if dont needed.Delivery was OK, 2 day shipping on time. The product received was not what was shown. It was very greatly used and not in very good condition. I will not purchase another product from this company. I need a qwerty keyboard for texting capabilities. This phone does the trick. Nice camera and decent phone call reception. I bought this phone before few days and it\\'s tottaly broken and screen doesn\\'t work. On first look it was good, but after few days the problems comes out. Screen is shaking, moving left and right without touch, and it\\'s not accurate. I\\'m going to refund and I\\'m tottaly disappointed, also I didn\\'t get accessories and charger is not original. excellent Rating based on phone itself!Just in case anyone in the states is wondering, regardless of what lte bands it says works they are NOT compatible with any USA LTE bands, Ive tried several tweaks, and modifications its simply not the same frequencies. Anyone hoping to use this on tmobile will only get HSPA+ at best. From other research the same can be said about ATT network.Avoid like the plague if LTE is a must, and you\\'re in the states.Other wise this phone is brilliant. First off, be sure you receive a D620R and not a D620K which drops the 800MHz LTE band needed for Europe. Go to Settings/About Phone/Hardware to verify the model.Pros:1. Small physical size for a 4.7\" display.2. Bright Display - you can see the pixels but they are small.3. The included File Manager can read/write to the external_SD card.4. Accepts 64GB microSD cards - just tap the error notification and the phone will reformat it to FAT32.5. Operation is snappy and it plays all the videos I tried smoothly.Cons:1. No light sensor so only manual brightness control.2. Small 8GB internal storage leaving only 3GB for you.Overall, I am pleased with this LG G2 mini phone. bueno Excellent, thanks for the phone .. it\\'s in top top condition......looks NEW. fantastic Irresponsible at the time of delivery ,I do not recommend them Great camera, awful OS. Windows 10 on this is like running Windows ME on a current flagship PC. no have spanish language, this phone, its a great problem for me. in the page this fone dont have a specificatios the languages The 5 start rating I am giving this is considering that it is cheap. For 99 bucks this is an amazing phone, but you will be disappointed if you compare it to a $500+ device like an Iphone 6 or Galaxy S6.I am floored at the capability and quality at this price point. Honestly at this low of a price I expected that it would be a piece of junk that I would be sending it back. The mass of positive reviews convinced my to give it a try. After 2 months I am hooked on BLU. I\\'m never getting a phone on contract or overpaying for a phone again.Pro- Value for money- Camera quality- Android 5.0- minimal bloatware- included silicon case and screen cover- Screen qualityCon- A little slow. Slim, light and great mobility. No tried to figure out how to return it. It download a lot emails from my yahoo. The the yahoo was no longer download and I could figure it out. Went to ATT store for help they couldn\\'t help at all. Then bought a head set and doesn\\'t recognize it\\'. Now I\\'ve order an att smartphone. Excellent Could bem the right charger, im from brazil and is totaly different, i had to buy a new charger. Bought this phone mainly for a back up phone. My main device is the studio C 5.0 HD I do prefer that device. There are a couple things about the lollipop system that I am not a fan of, but overall the the device functions as it should. Really nice phone like it hope there will be upgrades soon. Works great. I would buy from this buyer again. ......is not sold as advertised. This phone is not Unlocked in that sense we are all familiar with. The phone contains a ridiculous amount of AT&T\\'s stuff (I\\'m with Tmobile). The stuff is embedded everywhere, even in the internet connection settings, proxies, etc. You get errors with almost everything. Yes, there are ways you can reconfigure for t-mobile but why go through all of that? The camera is acceptable in good lighting and close proximity but the flash is weak, total darkness. What kills this phone for me are no 3.5mm hole for my headset and the inability (as far as I know) to select multiple texts, pictures, etc for deletion. You have to press backspace and confirm delete, the most annoying procedure ever.I regret the purchase, but will keep the phone for 2 reasons......the MP3 player is solid and the phone\\'s hardware and looks are admirable. This phone is only worthy of 1 star. Too bad, because I love candybar Qwerties.'"

       "'i loved it, so good phone was not what i ordered, very disappointed. will not order again. i was really mad at first because i thought i bought a broken phone. phone works they gave me a charger that was no good after a recent bad experience with a different phone from another company, i was skeptical about trying another uncommon brand. i\\'m very happy to say it has everything i wanted and so far it works perfectly. i\\'m loving this phone, especially for the price! the only major downfall i\\'ve found with this phone is that they don\\'t make phone cases for it. however, i did order a belt clip case so i at least have somewhere to safely carry it. everything ok no conecta bien .agarra pobre señal. at first, the phone looks nice, and without the ota update, can be used. after the system update, weird apps are automatically installed, demanding certain settings, which will bombard you with unwanted advertising and, weird communication to the internet. the chinese firmware doesn\\'t make it possible to disable, or remove this bloatware, and if you disable the usb security app, you have to go through the entire wizard with every restart.if you love your earned money and your privacy, i suggest you find another brand, that does take your privacy seriously. love otterbox, but this one did not fit the 5s :( received a full refund, excellent customer service! the phones are not high quality, but they are affordable and good starter phones for kids. awesome phone at a ver affordable price love it best phone i have owned yet 😊☺ the phone has a damage in the charging connect, i had to buy a desktop charger, i\\'m not satisfaid with the product. great cell phone, delivered on time and qith all the accesories.i didn t have any problem with the seller. in love i get compliments about my case often and it doesn\\'t fade or get dingy phone was nice but there wasn\\'t headphone excellent watch thanks it work great as a phone my son love it and use everyday also use as and ipod completely satisfied with this purchase. bad. is refurbish.. i\\'m very annoying. i\\'ve had this phone for five months and i am rating it three stars because of its questionable durability. i have dropped it a couple of times and i think that may be why neither the vibration function nor the front-facing camera no longer work. however i truly appreciate the bluetooth function for my car infotainment system and i appreciate the wifi for my chargepoint ap so that i can remotely cease charging my car. i normally don\\'t buy extended warrenties for electronics, but i wish that i had for this. i don\\'t like this phone, it is too slow pictures quality poor. and i need to send it back i have had a android for the past 6 years. i can\\'t remember the last blackberry model i had, but i remember i loved it. if you\\'re looking something for productivity, this is the device for you. i don\\'t play games and i don\\'t care about apps. all i care about are phone calls, text messages, my calendar, and email. this device is better than anything out there for those applications. call quality is far superior to any android i have owned. it is nice to have buttons to call and hangup. the keyboard is great, i forgot how much i had missed it. not having to charge the phone during the day is even better. this thing lasts all day with out any problems. i can not say this for any android device i\\'ve owned. now, for the con\\'s. it has limited app support presently. if you\\'re into apps, this may not be the device for you. if you don\\'t care about apps, this probably is the device for you. so far i love it. the build quality is better than any other phone out there. the phone sucks works great.....quick shipper....just as described. i got to say after 5 days of use, i absolutely love this phone. the small compact size is perfect for me and i don\\'t mind the thickness, i assume it\\'s thicker than most to put that bigger battery in. i thought it would be hard to go small since i\\'m coming from the iphone 6 plus, but wasn\\'t bad at all in my opinion. this is actually the first android phone that i can say i won\\'t be going back to my iphone. i get about 1 1/2 days of battery life at moderate use. so far my screen on time averages 4 hours, best was 4 hours 45 minutes. my last android phone was the 2015 moto x pure and that battery life was horrible along with others i have owned, nexus 5x, htc one m7, m8, m9, nexus 5, and so on which always made me go back to my iphone along with other reasons. i am in the united states and with at&t and can confirm lte works perfectly. no issues at all. also i didn\\'t have to manually put in the apn for mms or internet to work, u just make sure u have wifi connected and then go to settings, then more, then scroll down and hit internet settings. hit download and it will automatically download the correct settings for your carrier, make sure your carrier sim is installed. the camera is good enough for me, i\\'m no professional photographer so i just leave it in superior auto mode and it takes good pics in my opinion. i can confirm the phone back does get a little warm during some situations. first one was downloading all my apps from the play store at the same time. 2nd is using hangouts for video calls, other than that it has been fine. the heat it did get did not burn my hand and was still comfortable to hold and use. i did get the dp glass screen protector which i put on all my phones and i like it. i\\'m not a case kind of guy so waiting on my dbrand skin. i did get the white version and i have not had any screen issues or my on screen buttons not working on my bed. i assume others just got a defective unit. i got usb cord, earbuds, and a international plug in the box. just a side not i only have one hand and am super happy that a company actually makes a one handed device with great specs. most android phones i\\'ve had one handed use was very difficult if not impossible but had no choice if wanted top specs, so thank you sony for high end specs in a compact size. replacing an existing phone! wonderful i thought it only had one scratch as described but it had an noticeable crack at the corners very good. a great buy for anyone willing to spend not excessively for a smartphone yet get the taste of smartphone world. i gave this as a gift to my uncle. he loves it now. realy great excelent phone. perfect conditions excellent phone! great phone. kinda to big... i bought this phone mainly for taking photos (great quality), even got there camera attach kit cost me $$$ and 32gb sd card. phone broke after 3 month. very rarely used as well, a blue screen with code when i turn on, please help! or refund!! bad buy be aware i love it, i do recommend it. can\\'t get picture/sms messages on t mobile network. have to try another carrier. great phone! value for money. you won\\'t be disappointed. it was exactly what i wanted and what it said it was, few very minor scuffs but basically brand new and works perfectly so far.. the company it came from was nice to put two chargers and a set of earbuds in with it, made a really good impression on me to go to them again awesome excellent product arrived in time indicated my mother loves it! she raves and raves about this phone and then shows it off to everyone she meets. perfect phone! amazing! fast response,long batery duration time, beautiful display! the active display let me forget to unlock by pressing power button.wonderful touchless control! hope android 5.0 upgrade! i am a little disappointment because when i reviewed thew red mode, it doesn\\'t have 4g option and the description it has!! :(otherwise the phone is very nice. the display will fade away after 3 seconds of use. i don\\'t know if this usually happens but this has to change. i can barely see what\\'s going on. excelent when i bought this product it was because the item model was rcn72uw, which works with the 3g bands that i need. this phone was bought for international use so the model offered was sipposed to be alright. once i took the phone to venezuela (the country where this was going to be used) i realized that it was not the style on the product description. so it is being used as a 2g phone. the seller told me to send it back but it was already in venezuela so it would be too expensive to return the product. great! works like new excellent phone!! it took a while to get it but let me tell you that it was a great purchase. easy to operate, speakers in the right place with full functionality. i recommend this phone to anyone looking to upgrade! my third otterbox, and a big disappointment - i really liked the fingerprint unlock feature of the s5. you can\\'t use it with this case. the sensor is very particular (which is a good thing), and this case does not allow swiping with a flat finger, so the sensor fails to allow me in every time. i had to switch to a pin. i also had to remove the screen protector. it collected dust underneath. lastly, it\\'s really hard to keep the rubber case in place. it likes to come off the hard case in places. don\\'t waste your $$$ and posh\\'s customer service is horrible & unco\\'operative good phone,good price,come in on time . i bought this phone to have it shipped to venezuela as a present for my brother. when he turn it on, it asked him for a code. this phone was sold as a locked to a carrier phone. now i have to spend money out of my pocket to have it jailbreak so that he can use it there. very disappointed with this purchase. i had a couple otterbox over the years and loved them all. not this one. the fingerprint reader is covered and the white housing picks up a nasty gray color after a couple weeks of use. unit arrived ok and appears to be functional. the charger however had no compatible plug (male) and i am still not able to charge it without borrowing someone\\'s charger. my son loves it even tho i had to send the other one back & received another one... excelent it\\'s big, it\\'s bold and this one is blue. not much to complain about because everything i dislike about this phone was clearly mentioned in the description so can\\'t say i was unaware.cons:screen resolutionsystem memoryspeakers (worst of any phone i\\'ve ever had) even with earphones/budssize...too bigpros:battery life (best of any phone i\\'ve ever owned)service, despite being only a 3g hspa phone driving around downtown and going into tunnels i\\'ve yet to lose gps signal which in my book is awesome, service signal is also top notch, i get 2-3 bars in places where people i\\'ve been with lose their signal completely.size...i know i know, i also listed this under the cons, but its a double edge sword, on the one hand the immense size can at times be some what inconvenient doesn\\'t fit properly in pants pockets, hard to find cases (that\\'s true with all blu phones though), but when watching videos on youtube or movies or using the google maps its always good to have a bigger screen so take it for what its worth. i like the phone it does everything other high end phones do at a fraction of the price but don\\'t expect it to perform just as good, for it\\'s price range and size you can\\'t go wrong. it arrived defective bought it from wireless everything. they had good ratings overall which encouraged me. very vast shipping. phone came with a u.s. electricity power supply, no international sockets although it came with a separate international adapter outside the phone box. no seal on the box but the phone was brand new with all wrapping. when turned on, the language was defaulted to english u.s., you just click ok. color looks fantastic, way better than white or blue. phone made in china, not korea, or at least this color. i hope it hold for a while. not sure yet about the quality of the battery. i will update my review in few weeks. works with metropcs, t-mobile, and at&t.i hope sony will provide the android 4.4 (kitkat) for this model soon.picture is great, movie is great, and sound is great!the quality of display is really great too!battery life could get really short if you use navigation, music, and drive recorder at the same time.(drive recorder program installed separately), i bought this for development (not an apple fan) but it does everything just fine. finally a phone that doesn\\'t make me crazy. have ditched my overpriced samsung galaxy s6 that never worked properly for this perfectly good replacement that didn\\'t cost the moon. totally satisfied. amazon accidentally boxed the colors wrong, so i received a white phone -- twice -- when i had ordered a black one, but i decided i didn\\'t care enough to return it a second time. (the actual sellers -- buyerush -- were super-responsive and helpful, though, and would gladly have facilitated things had i held out for a black one.) i dont reall like what i receive cos the phone dont have a charge and battery, and the person who sale the phone did not put or say the phone did not have such item, then pls adviced people dat post phone on ur site to make sure the write what they have or how the product it so that when any buyer will no what is buying, pls tell hime to sent me the charge and the battery so dat the phone will be complete, thanks i\\'ve had this phone for about 5 months now and it is my 1st smart phone. battery life is short when browsing via wifi or with cell data. i don\\'t do spybook just check email and other simple stuff. camera is ok if you have bright light if you need to depend on flash forget it. video tends to blur a lot with movement. call quality is ok. i did take case off and make mike hole and protective cover hole bigger now most people can hear me. os is very stable it rarely locks up if so just restart the app. i would buy this again and recommend it to a person who doesn\\'t need a lot of apps and is just a basic phone user. price is right. very good deal i wanted a cell phone with a qwerty keyboard, and that\\'s what i got. the wifi connection is spotty and drops repeatedly. the apps for facebook and twitter worked on day1 and haven\\'t worked again since (two weeks ). i have never been able to access the internet. my 2004 samsung clamshell, which i replaced with this one, was more intuitive. serious buyer\\'s remorse. takes hours to charge (3-5hours). pretty basic phone. not that great. i just received the phone and have been using it only for one day. to put things in perspective, i bought this unlocked phone to cover for my broken samsung s5, so my phone use/expectation is at least a year (or two) old. i like the z30 phone. it reminds me of the glorious bb days for all the right reasons. the keyboard is especially good. other commenters have bragged about the keyboard, and i now know why. camera... nah.. just so so!the bb blend is a really useful feature. and i am loving it because once you are in the office and connected to the desktop, you don\\'t need your phone except to make/receive calls. the push technology is good; i seemed to get notifications before it shows up in my email inbox. the call quality is good, too!my reason for 3 stars -- the apps ecosystem is woefully inadequate, even with the amazon appstore for some reason. i have not had the time to check it all out... and this phone has the latest os. on top of that, i learned whatsapp will not support and will discontinue for this os after dec. 31. so buyer beware! not able to install my vonage extensions app, either!at this point, i am disappointed for that reason, as i will be having a very expensive equipment that will be less and less worth. i used to be a big fan of bb, and i still love this z30 phone for all it does, but unfortunately there is a lot it does not, compared to all the other phones that are out there. therein lies the rub! for just phone and email use -- if this is all one needs to use -- this is a good product!i don\\'t know if i can return it back for a refund...because as much as i would like not to, unfortunately i don\\'t see myself using this phone for long for all the things it is lacking... it\\'s a good phone that runs smoothly. the cameras stand up pretty well even after almost a year after it was bought, you just have to zoom in rather than getting close to very small objects. the screen has no cracks or scratches unlike many top brands and the two year warranty is very comforting. the earbuds have not broken or been distorted in any way, which was one of the main reasons i got this over others in the price range. it is very easy to use and customizable like most androids, but this is completely off contract and can be easily used on prepaid. because twice i got a phone with a burn thru on the screen ,from the same company& it still has some other problems. phone arrived and appeared new and in a sprint iphone box. however, when brought to the sprint store to activate they advised that it was not a sprint phone and they would be unable to activate it for service. what is the pin number for the phone? the security pin? i need this.. thank you. it is a simple quad band, good for use overseas. i use a cdma here in the us so i buy this when i travel overseas. the phone came in a sealed apple box and really does look like new. the only thing which was odd, was that when i checked for apple warranty online they told me that the warranty was expired and the phone was produced more than 2 years ago. customer service guaranteed me that still the phone was new and not refurbished and i was sticking with that, as really everything else seemed like new.another small thing which is odd: this phone has chinese preinstalled as language in all apps and many sub menus. although changing the primary language to english it was not possible to remove chinese completely as a language. i tried to get around that by installing spanish as a second language so chinese is now only third. nevertheless chinese signs keep popping up from time to time on the phone. i keep waiting for the article good great phone and great value, my son loves it. working excelent on argentina carriers, the phone is a little heavy but it is worth it. love it were it all the time. this would turn out to be my third phone in the past 4 months... my first phone was an alcatel one touch fierce... then i upgraded to the blu life pure and i\\'ll admit that was a great phone... but the phone fell into the ocean while at the beach...so i got this phone... this is the best phone i have ever had.pros:both cameras work well in all lightingscreen is very clearphone speed is very fast on both wi-fi and cellular datai bought a 16gb sd card and our works fine with the phone despite others saying that android 4.4 has sd card problemseverything else is greatconssim and sd card can only be put in one the battery is taken outonce the battery is taken out and put it back in, then you have to log in to all apps( facebook, twitter etc..)it gets hot really fastso all in all, this phone has the greatest value. it has a way better value as compared to the moto g the phone was fine except that within a week of having the phone it began to have problems charging...i bought several charges thinking that was the problem. it however was not the issue, it was the phone itself. i do not reccomend the item due to the fact that it was defective. so far so good phone is working, granddaughter very happy. watch is hard to hear phone call and is horrible this phone is absolutely amazing & this is the first iphone i\\'ve ever had :). the battery is better than android because i only need to charge it every 2 days instead of everyday. it\\'s very well designed & i\\'ll stick with apple for a very long time haha. hasn\\'t been 6 months and it already cutting on and off by it self and the battery shows critical battery and when charging it shows its charging only to be dead when taken off. i love this bt watch, i\\'ve had it a month and it has held up well. the software is easy to use, it may not be as nice as its more expensive counterparts but it works just fine and is a good way to see if having a bt watch is something you would like to invest money in down the road. just don\\'t get it wet, although it\\'s a watch it\\'s still technically a cell phone. everything ok. excelent product so far so good. we are with verizon but do not want to pay for device payments and have always purchased samsung phones used or refurbished from a store here. with samsung the way it\\'s been the last year, we decided to move away from them for awhile. this motorola g•4 plus is great so far. it\\'s not my old note but it does everything i need it to do so far. i will miss my hancom office program however. for $260 it was a steal! screen is bright and responsive. speakers are greatl. even my husband can hear me better on speaker phone with this new phone. the camera is also great. i was able to pop my sim right in from verizon and i was up an running! i love not being stuck with a carrier until device payments are done. i pair my phone with a poetic slim clear case that i love. paid for priority shipping and got it even sooner than expected! great phone, great seller.. completely satisfied w/my purchase! thx! :) i purchased this phone as a replacement for a broken touch screen phone. i was afraid the buttons being so small would present a problem because i have large hands but i have a no trouble texting or dialing out. this phone does everything i need it to do. they sold me a used article when he was allegedly new. the detached display and the serial number of the fuzzy cover. good.. after 6 months usage my device got an update that got it bricked and stuck in a boot loop, i contacted htc to find out this device was user unlocked illegally not factory unlocked as stated in the product title! why i called them? my device was bricked due to wrong software updates assignment due to mismatch between location and updates. my device was updated with an ineligible software making it seem like the device had been rooted with a corrupt software! the device was initially locked to an australian carrier called optus. the device is beyond repair and i\\'m reporting this to amazon for fraud. it works excelente this cellphone is a piece of sh.. after 3 months started to cause problem and is no longer available for returns... the screen is freeze and i can not do anything to solve the problem it reached all my expectations. battery is enough for one day at heavy use, which is not much, but acceptable. been using it for almsot 2 days and haven\\'t encountered any issues. it was kinda difficult to get my phone to connect because you have to install an app and some software but it\\'s sorted out with the booklet. great phone for a great price! does everything i need it to and easy to use. works well with straight talk wireless service.a couple of things that weren\\'t clear to me from reading the product description: the phone requires a standard sim card and the charger cord is not compatible with u.s. outlets. let me just say that this buy was absolutely amazing! it arrived when it said, the phone is beautiful, and brand new! i\\'m more than happy with this purchase. i love this phone. the first smartphones i ever got was a blackberry. my second one was also a blackberry. then i got an iphone and now the priv. this is a gorgeous looking phone. the camera is topnotch. for some i had really missed the physical keyboard. the performance is great. this beats iphone and samsung. the only problem ifyou call it that is the battery life.blackberry definitely made the right choice in switching to android and i hope blackberry more great phones like the priv. blackberry has the edge over the other phones: privacy. that\\'s really important for work purposes. i needed a basic phone for my elderly father and this worked out perfectly. he did not want any of the modern \"smart phones\" but rather a simple and basic phone. the ruggedness and built in flash light are plus as well. the call quality is clear and the ringers are quite loud. the only reason i did not rate it five stars is because of the size. it is somewhat too small for the palm of a grown man. my phone was dead out of the box. it wouldn\\'t take a charge. never would power on. quality control for this product must be very lacking. when you pay this amount of money for a phone you expect great quality. the price paid is worth it, is a pocket pc, lighter than the earlier and much faster, fine by samsung this time. it\\'s so simple but so much necessary features like flashlight, radio and analog tv. perfect for the less digital places. i received this phone in excellent condition. i ordered. this for my daughter and she is very pleased amd excited. good phone for the price i got this phone after many years of using the iphone, so i am not used to android. needless to say, i have to give myself time, but i am wishing i had my iphone. the feel and coloring is perfect. just a little slow and dificult for me to work it properly. going to give my self time though. i ordered this a few weeks ago and was really excited about receiving it. coincidentally the day before my n95-4 arrived, nokia released a new firmware update so the first thing i did was update the software on my n95-4 to the latest version.during the update process i noticed the usb port on the phone itself seemed loose but thought nothing of it. after the update was done i began to use the phone and i ended up returning it to amazon the next day! you\\'ve seen all the positive reviews, so i won\\'t rehash that, but here are why i returned it:- the usb port on my n95-4 was extremely loose or broken. you had to apply a lot of pressure and push the cable in and then not touch it for it to stay connected. it was so loose that a breeze from the window could disconnect the device from the pc. i tried several usb cables, computers/ports with no success.- the usb transfer speed is horrific for a device that comes with 8gb. it took almost 2.5 hours to transfer about 4gb of music to the device using windows media player. using mass storage mode is just as slow since this uses usb 2.0 full-speed (old spec) not usb 2.0 high-speed (common today). no matter what people tell you this is absolutely frustrating and annoying over time, even if you don\\'t transfer stuff much.- the slider on the phone is wobbly and whenever i pressed a button on the keypad it made a creaking sound that i don\\'t expect from a $600 phone. it did not feel solid at all, at least not my n95-4- the overall size of the device is surprisingly small but the thing is as thick as a brick which makes it awkward to carry in your pant pocket or worse jeans pocket.- even without really installing any apps on it the thing would randomly slow down and not respond to key presses and then just \"wake up\" all of a sudden it was bizarre.- does not charge via usb. not used to this so was annoying that you have to at times have both a usb cable and nokia charger plugged in.i ended up getting a nokia n78 (us 3g) that was just recently released and i\\'m extremely happy with it. it addresses most if not all of the issues i had with the n95-4 including fastest usb, fast cpu/responsive, excellent build quality.i would recommend looking at the n78 or the upcoming n96 (successor to n95) over the n95-4. samsung is the absolute best. this phone is amazing. great phone the purchase of my phone was excellent just had a little problem when the goods arrive at the miami dierccion empty box came quick fix but everything you gave me really answer immediately all his service is very good thank you very much this phone is great. i\\'ve never rated a product before but i feel like i had to for this product. i\\'ve seen people posted all sort of negative reviews about this phone including but not limited to too little instructions. are you kidding me? if you don\\'t know have to use an android phone, don\\'t buy an android phone. this phone operates the same way as any other android phone, for the most part. the only thing i would mention is i wish it has a light to indicate miss calls/texts and charging in progress. the button at the bottom has to be pressed very hard to get the phone to work. i called the company and they said i would have to send the phone back. i did not have a back up phone so they said the only other thing they could do is refund me $35 out of the $289.00. i took it because i thought maybe it would pay to get it fixed but when i asked how much it would be to get it fixed they said starting at $64. this is a great, inexpensive phone. other reviewers complain of things that are missing, and i\\'ll agree that a flash for the camera, a rear facing camera, and a larger internal sd card would be great. however, for the money i can\\'t see beating this (date: july 2014). i like this phone, i was skeptical because of reviews saying it couldn\\'t be connected to straight talk, but i live in california and had no trouble at all, got my same number and everything. i just had to pay $6.99 to get the network access code and that was it! i do see the battery goes kinda fast and sometimes the phone doesn\\'t seem to like the charger(sometimes its goes on and off charge, but it does charge), but other than that it\\'s great! i bought this refurbished phone because mine was old and wouldn\\'t hold a charge for more than a 4-5 hours and i didn\\'t want to spend a ridiculous amount of money on a brand new phone. i was skeptical after reading some reviews, but the refurbished phone works great! no visible damages, either. the only problem is that it didn\\'t come with a sim card. i called my carrier to have one shipped, but they needed some number that was not included with the phone so i had to go into the local store to have a sim card installed. very good cell phone. i recommend it love it , no problem works amazing ! works great good camera runs smoothly and works with my carrier perfectly even this t-mobile sucks in general it says \"lte\". but it doesn\\'t work in argentina, with argentinian carriers. you can see more information at: http://www.willmyphonework.net/ the shipment time take too long. when i receive the product, the product is defected. sometimes it works and sometime is not. supplier feedback is good. they try to fix problem or refuned to me. i change the setting and it is not stable. what you can said. it is only watch. not really good for cell phone. i would give supplier positive review, but the product itself is not as good as you thought.gsm quadband voice dialing watch cell phone unlocked friends in west africa love it!! its fast and takes great pictures... so far it all works great... my husband likes the phone!! more features n the touch the camera capability is ugh! i am very satisfied with my phone. it came in brand new condition. works great too! i had to use my old phone\\'s charger though, because the charger that came with the phone doesn\\'t work properly. works well this review is for the tablet that goes in this wonderful case. the samsung galaxy note 10.1 is a great tablet if you get one with a good power supply. search the net and you will see that numerous people had this problem. and i have to pay for repairs on my tablet because samsung doent\\' want to admit the tablet is flawed. i had this case on the device from the day i bought it and there is no way it became damaged.so, case good.. tablet that its made for is not.. i suggest you take pictures of the tablet, make sure you get pics of the power button and maybe do a little movie to show there is no problem before you put the tab. in the case. also, put your sd card in the device before you put on the case..mi started calling about the power problem 3 weeks after i bought it. bear in mind, i put an otter box on the tablet the day i got the tablet.samsung told me that it was a simple fix just press the power button and vol. at the same time and it would fix the problem. well. i called from december to april was told over and over it just needed to be reset. it finally started powering off and on at exactly 5sec on and 5sec off. this seems to note an internal problem. i still sent it in. and now i\\'m told i broke the power button and i needed to send $150 to repair it.i explained that i had the tablet look at by a friend who teaches computer. and he looked it over and said, i would have to send it in as there were no outward signs of a problem.this tablet has power problems that will only be fixed if you send it in. so, if you don\\'t mind rolling the dice with a product that is documented with known faults that samsung will not admit to.. then enjoy your limited time with the tablet. good, every thing very good.es lo que esperaba,tambien fue enviado en el lapso prometido.considero que es una buena opcioon para comprar great phone. worked properly in argentina, with 4g lte connection. i bought this for my husband because he doesn\\'t like or want a smartphone. he had an older version of this phone, many years old, and it lasted forever until the battery finally gave out. for about $50 more i was able to get him this new one. it is a great little phone, very slim and light, and the camera and standard features work great. would recommend for someone who just wants a phone for making and receiving calls, simple texts, and a few pictures here and there. i like the phone by to ways, its good screen size and the conectivity, runs perfect in venezuela digitel. and big screen allows easy book readings with pdf viewers. my only complaint is 2 things. its extrange native launcher and stubborn die hard apps that always meddle and (may be because of the last) the battery doesnt last good. also delivery experience was terrible but not because of the seller. we have many handiccaps to buy in venezuela. its almost impossible to buy from amazon as of lately.in all other aspects this phone is very good. can be customized. uses fm radio withput data usage. easy memory on browser tabs, easy handling for reading books, good screen size. good wow factor. good fabric and materialsi also bought a 16 gb sd card for memory expand uses so the 4 internal gb space disk is no issuety for reading not fully compatible with t-mobile in the usa i guess i thought i was buying a brand new phone so when my husband said the ear piece wasn\\'t working i was takenback. it was a fake samnsung!!!!i was deceived by the seller!!! this item was exactly what i expected and works just fine very pleased with my purchase. it arrived on time and just as it was advertised. 🔥 not good the screen not big enough and can barely hear the phone display stopped working in 6 months and i cannot use the phone. it is an excellent smart phone with the such price. in good condition, good quality and excellent performance great phone until i dropped it. fast, clean, decent price. no bloatware, unless you count some of the moto stuff like the hand motions and the moto version of siri. both of which i found useful, especially the shake for flashlight. excellent would buy this again i love this phone, it\\'s very functional and modern, it got a lot of stuff; but what i love best is that when you are playing music without headsets it sounds pretty good and loud so thats cool. great purchase as always nokia is the best. my only gripe: the 928\\'s beautiful, wide screen can crack easily if it falls on one of its corners. otherwise, this is an impressive phone, with an exceptional camera. windows 8 takes some getting used to, but it\\'s actually quite refreshing after having used apple. i\\'ve never used android. the app store isn\\'t the biggest, but it has most of the best known applications out there. some of nokia\\'s apps are exceptional too, including the filters for photos. the gps, here drive, is functional, but drains the battery fast. use your charger while operating. the phone is elegant too. a well-designed, pocket computer. and it\\'s free from verizon with a contract. excellent phone, best relationship price benefit simply the best good excelente the operating system sucks!!!! not very user friendly..i was not pleased..and would have loved to get my money back ! perfect not pleased as i\\'m unable to get anything saved to the sd card, not sure if it\\'s the brand new card or the phone itself causing this issue. bought it for my 8 yr old daughter and i\\'m disappointed to see it not work as it should giving it being her first smartphone. a bit on the small side and battery dies fairly quickly i believe this is a good phone for a person who is not a heavy phone user such as myself. i have noticed there is a little lag with the auto rotation in text, but that is not a big deal. i really enjoy the resolution, good amount of pixels over a 3.7\\'\\' screen equals crisp and beautiful screen. i am a little concerned however that the memory may not be the greatest due to all the bloatware. they are putting the same amount of bloatware on this thing as they do on the samsung galaxy s2!! i think i might freeze the apps if i have the guts to possibly put the device in risk....overall brilliant phone, it is good-looking and i hope that it is durable. i would not say the build was the best...seems very plastic-based. good excelent cellphone loved my galaxy! some items can only be displayed in chinese. these include sim card number in notificationshave issues with data. it starts as 4g but then drops data connection despite displaying 3g.have tested many times and its not a coverage problem.when restarted data sometimes works again.switching back to my s6 duos if you going abroad, good choice. and even with the possibility fot 2 simcards. just got it. it works with a norwegian simcard. just tried it. camera,,,, really crisp pictures, they are saved by day, nice featuresending pictures, to send a picture all you need to do is check the pictures you are sending, text or email.. so simple..easy to set up pages, and move icons.plenty of customizable features.problems, if you move and icon onto home page\\'s, it is saved and uses more space..has too many apps pre downloadedconstantly updating the predown loaded apps,, annoying ..still have not been able to customize rings for each person in address book.bigest problem ring tones selection, bites.. i like an old phone ring,,they only have science fiction type ringsand songs dont play loud enough to get my attention. over all;; compared to my last phone, htc one,, the camera is great, the phone hasnt slipped out of my hand and droppedso far i am very happy with the phone. just too many pre loads on it taking up space and updating all of the time drains the battery as well. one day i will get around to deleting em.. i love the phone so much great phone. i like it better than the crappy motorola phone i was using. switched the phone over quite easily. good phone for a teenager who continually drops and mistreats his device. texting is not easy, but i prefer to speak with him rather than text. very good! this purchase was to replace my old twist phone that broke i really like this phone and it works fine very happy.verizon cannot find this phone nor can asurion wanted to give me some off brand p.o.s. found my own thanx guys. very nice phone. had some problems when it arrived. everything was in spanish. once got language straightened out. and got the correct size simm card, works great. love it. only 200 and this phone is just as good as any. just got it a few days ago and i can\\'t believe how great it is. i used to have samsung s4 and this is 80% better. better camera and even faster speed of service. my messages used to take 1 2 min to send and receive. this phone does it within 2 seconds. such a huge change but i am so happy with getting this. it could not have been better. get this phone ! i highly recommend it. its also big !:) i did buy two phones, one arrived with no bone damage was irreparable served i\\'ve been using this phone for about a month and it\\'s working great for a refurbished iphone 5c! there is a small, minor scratch on the screen that isn\\'t noticeable when the screen is on, and a small portion of the apple logo is scratched off of the back. but i can\\'t complain because they do warn that there will be minor damage on the exterior of the phone. it came with the charger. i wanted there to be headphones too, but that\\'s just wishful thinking. so far so good i had it about a month now and it works great!! with no problems! camera leaves a lot to be desired. will be fine if your not planing on trying to produce award winning photos. otherwise, quite worth the money if your looking for a nice smartphone and don\\'t want to pay upward of $700.00! will not work on t mobiles 4g lte is a great phone. besides, the camera is great. is really fast and easy to use. one thing that is not so great is the size and weight. is a little bigger and heavy than i am use to. the rest is great. dislike it didn\\'t work :-( phone works. no functionality problems. the problem is the content. the guy im assuming it was a guy who owned this phone before i did, had an interesting still frame still on the movie player app even though the file was deleted, porn. sanitized the phone, im not squeamish. don\\'t think im going to get a used modern smart phone again. excelente power button can be a bit wiggly but this is a good windows phone. no 8.1 update or cortana, but this phone is a good buy. excellent product bad conditions. reviewing the item i discover that part of the main board is broken, specifically on the sim card pins. did not send the smart tags mentioned on the description of the item. phones battery dies really fast and doesn\\'t work very good. not very pleased with this purchase. muy bueno good phone i\\'ve had this phone for 5 months now and still love this phone. like how it comes with case and screen cover. like the usb port on the top of the phone, good for laying in bed and using phone while its charging. camera is better than most at 13mp. seriously the brightest torch/flashlight i\\'ve ever seen on a phone; compared with friends\\' iphone 5, xperia z1 and galaxy s5; this phone would be necessary if lost in dark woods. has many small features that no other phones have; scrolling text on lock display, options to add widgets that still work on lock display. i would highly recommend this to people, just not close friends (i don\\'t want them to have such a nice phone as me!) keep it up #bluproducts it is durable, waterproof, and great if you just want a basic phone for calling and texting. the only cons about this phone is that it is bulky but i can deal with. inntime all perfect great phone for the first few weeks. the screen on mine \"bleed\" until the whole screen was black. great dealfound it open box for $350 ushonestly best phone with dual front facing speakers on the marketalcatel needs to get on the the high end snapdragons to compete exactly what i was expecting. arrived quickly. thank you i wanted a cheap fitness tracker with clock.the bad: the pedometer said unavailable, the sleep tracker said unavailable, and i could only find the sedentary alert once- don\\'t know if that worked.the middle: the band on it is huge. i\\'m a big girl that usually uses extra links in a watch, and i was on the second to last hole here. it\\'s thicker and heavier than i expected, but i think i would get used to it.the good: even though i didn\\'t want to connect it to my phone, it connected easily to my iphone 6. i could get my music, even though it wasn\\'t very loud. i liked the idea of an fm radio. even though the headphones didn\\'t fit, good sound quality. love it best blu phone yet!!! purchased for spouse,he loves it. wife really likes it. i love it my cricket sim card works what a lot of people don\\'t seem to take into consideration is that this company is somewhat new with phones and there are going to be \"some\" that come off the assembly line with issue. every company has this issue yet most people don\\'t see the samsung/apple issues as much.don\\'t be swayed into thinking this is a bad phone, in general, because someone (here and there) gets a bad one. that\\'s why amazon has a replacement policy that non-lazy people make great use of rather than whine and complaining about getting a bad phone and doing nothing.these phones are very light and pretty thin so they will break (easily) when you drop them on hard surfaces. to \"prevent\" this, order a \"tempered\" protection screen and an anti \"shock\" case with the phone (total of $20 investment) and you\\'re well covered.i, personally, use straight talk at&t on mine and it works great. with phone coverage there\\'s no getting it and it\\'s great everywhere. some places, like stores, tend to kill signals and it\\'s normal.my business is under large power lines and i still get a really good signal, which is abnormal for cell phones here. the data/sms may need a little tweaking on the settings but to, again, non-lazy individuals...it\\'s 15-20 mins of research to find it on google.as far as camera goes, the back is great and the front is a bit granular but, again, this is expected. know about \"megapixels\" before you but a phone and say, \"this isn\\'t what i expected\". the front camera is 2mp, that\\'s a decade old technology. it\\'s not supposed to be super-crisp and sharp. however, better lighting does improve it. the darker things get on cameras, the worse the photo can look. for skype, it will suffice.the gps on this phone is actually good and when i say good i mean, when you\\'re sitting still and when google maps is tracking you going down the road. now, with gps, if you\\'re in a heavily wooded area (with lots of trees close to the road) you can lose signal no matter how good your gps is supposed to be.the sound is really great in a normal, not overly loud situation. i\\'ve sit and listened to music both by speaker and bluetooth and it\\'s worked great. if you get outside (with a lot going on around you), get close to traffic, or drive with a window open...of course the quality is going to drop down. even inside, with fans and old air-conditions, the sound quality can diminish because you have to be \"realistic\". these are tiny speakers. what would you expect from them...rock concert quality? no. if you don\\'t like the sound, get a bluetooth, stand alone, speaker with a bigger speaker built-in for better sound.i hear a lot of people complain about, \"i can\\'t hear the ringtone\" with cell phone. okay, some \"reality\" here. when you\\'re \"out\" and the cell phone is in your pocket or you\\'re in and you\\'re in a loud situation (even if you don\\'t see it as loud) you won\\'t hear it. my advice, to remedy this issue, is get a \"smart\" watch that connects with it and vibrates (and gives info) about who\\'s calling. i do this because i don\\'t like missing calls and the smart watch has saved me on a lot of this. the vibration allows me to know someone is calling without disturbing my situation if i\\'m dealing with clients.the bluetooth, i\\'ve used a headset (kinivo, stereo i love it, sold here) and walked as far as 35 yards away from the phone in the open and 20-25 yards when the phone was inside a building and there was a lot of electronics running. bluetooth signal strength depends as much on the headset as it does on the phone, this is not a one-way situation. you can have a phone with the best bluetooth on the planet and you get a headset with a weak signal and you\\'re still going to get poor response. it takes getting good on both sides.the wifi and data are the same. a router, that emits good signal will work great with this phone even up to a distance of 20-30 yards away as long as it\\'s a good router and there is little in-between to block the signal. the data all depends on the towers and, like gps, can be poor is heavily wooded areas, especially if you are down in a valley and the tower is on the other side of a mountain.i am, normally, a samsung person but i bought this phone as a backup and it\\'s been worth the money. i even ordered one for my head of security, which has a side job where she does physical labor. she followed my advice about protecting the phone and just raves about how \"well\" it works. and when something i order her doesn\\'t work...believe me...i hear about it. lol.sound loudness/quality - 4.5 out of 5bluetooth response and distance - 4 out of 5camera front/back - 3.75 out of 5gps speed/accuracy - 4.5 out of 5wifi / data - 4 out of 5 the service has been great, unfortunately my phone was defective, but my contact (david) has been working with all the way.he is working to make it all good. does not work for verizon wireless, waste of money. excellent recommend. excelent yes ,it came on time and was very useful great phone! love it! very disappointed.... had this phone only 6 days and now it wont charge....just sent it back...i don\\'t recommend it horrible wouldn\\'t work couldn\\'t text call receive calls i love it love my mini smartphone! i find the nokia x3-02 easy to work with the basic features. the phone is rather small with small screen, great for basic needs to include the usage of media features like the web and radio, sending photos. i would not recommended for folks that are looking for fancy features and have lots of experience with cell phones. all was excelent good had this phone for about two weeks now and i love it. first of all, the color green is so beautiful and bright. i ,love the screen resolution, to me its better than a samsung s4. the camera is ok but to me when you take the pictures with instagram it comes out much better. if you are thinking of buying this do so you wouldn\\'t be disappointed..... has no nfc ---who builds a phone without nfc today at this price point the phone was supposed to be new but it clearly wasn\\'t. the battery is shot and drains itself completely in about an hour. and when i plugged it into the computer there was already someone\\'s name associated with it. phone calls hands-free is awesome! no longer works for sprint, seller took it back but he wasn\\'t thrilled about it. i wish they still made phones like that. its what i wanted perfect! the phone arrived right on time. it was in great shape and worked great. i\\'m very satisfied with my phone. moto g4 plus. what a great $300 phone. it replaces a nexus 6p 128g that died after nougat upgrade. no nfc but everything else is great. great and accurate finger print scanner (actually prefer it on the front), good pictures, good sound, beautiful screen, perfect size at 5.5\", stock android, solid build, great battery life that lasts all day with turbo charging! i wish this phone was out before i spent $700 on a 6p. the seller technomaster contacted me and told me that the telephone is really unlocked worldwide, they had their provider and samsung unlock the phones before importing them to the us. so only the sticker in italian is wrong, it should have been removed. i am changing from 3 to 5 stars my rating of technomaster.this is the original review i wrote, before being contacted by technomaster:the phone was bought in the us, but i received a model for europe, with instructions in italian(!) saying that the phone is for europe and in order to avoid region locking, the phone has to be activated in europe with an european sim card m(and make a 5 minute call with the european sim card. if you don\\'t read italian and activate the phone in the americas, the phone will be locked (while you bought an unlocked phone!).even if the phone says \"international version\", that doesn\\'t mean that a customer has to know about the unfortunate region locking \"feature\" by samsung and that the phone bought in the us has to be activated in europe. it is not honest from samsung (and the vendor in the us) to not specify exactly these restrictions in the specs of the phone, and not tell you when buying that the phone has to be used first in europe. nice phone, feels solidly built and feels nice. for a phone of this price you cannot go wrong for a daily user. however, if your more of a phone enthusiast this would most likely not be the phone for you. i had recently lost my old iphone 5c and was in desperate need for a new phone. i just recieved a used iphone 5c 32gb from dutchmoney10. although it did come in ahead of time i am not happy with the condition and further problems that came with this iphone. the seller neglected to notify that the phone did not come with an \"active\" sim card which was told to me while i was attempting to set up the new phone through at&t at my house. now i will have to pay an extra 36 dollars to purchase and activate the new sim card. i don\\'t understand why they would deactivate the previous sim card so that it is completely useless and basically trash and then proceed to not notify me and to make it my problem to dispose of. the product description listed that the phone had a few minor blemishes and scratches on the back but come to find out all four corners are chipped and the back side is is torn up like it was thrown across pavement. also the on/off button is loose and is difficult to press. i am not happy with this seller and the only reason that i will keep this phone is because i am in such dear need for a phone. i will never buy a used phone again and especially not from dutchmoney10 and i suggest you don\\'t either its deffinitely worth it to splurge a little for something with better quality. very limited compatibility. even took it to the \"geek squad\" (which was more than i should have to do) and they could not sync it. do not recommend. muy bueno its good i love everything about this phone except the battery doesnt last that much long. i have a lot of apps and i know that runs down the battery faster than normal but generally, the phone is great. i highly recommend it to anyone who wants something affordable and quality. the bluetooth did not work properly after many tries. i returned it. disappointing from samsung with this expensive phone!!!! not worth a review for the waste of my time i love i love this set. product arrived on time. the phone looks nice. zena guys are good with their service too. best mobile if you are looking for touch and type. totally works fine! i don\\'t know how to get rid of the spam splash screens (it pops up as verizon and there are all these junk applications) but it seems ot work perfectly fine with straight talk, so i do appreciate that. it\\'s super easy to install, just follow the instructions and look forward to cell phone savings!!!! a very nice phone but i am disappointed with the memory. good this phone is awesome, it does everything!! i bought it for my brother and he was more than happy. you can play tons of games football, mario, tennis, surf the web wherever you are, google maps, radio, even the ringtones are fun! worth the price. works well good it has a very good relation, price/performance. the phone did not work! do not buy from this person. excelent nope. received on time. my daughter loves her replacement phone.only complaint is that the battery goes down fast, not a big deal she turns it off at school. good looking product.fast transport very good it\\'s ok but it freezes up from time to time. excellent product nive but have not chance to change languaje, still nice phone, perfect for pictures and internet, we recomended htc phone good my iphone that i ordered from amazon worked great. i had no issues with turning it on or getting it activated. came unscathed with charging equipment. i am highly satisfied and love my phone! update: the issue was solved. the sim card was the problem not the phone.i bought this phone to my wife, she is so happy with it. the only thing that could be a complaint is that in my country lte does not work with it.telephone carrier claro ecuador i chose this rating because the phone isn\\'t working good, whenever i\\'m on the phone i can barely hear and also the phone came with the menu in spanish language meanwhile i\\'m not spanish. i\\'m not recommending this product to no one excellent phone. good for dowload, watching and keep videos. good internet connection and easy to use it. i love it! exelente i love the phone just got it yesterday but one thing it would have been so nice if the apps were assemble like samsung apps . horrible phone didn\\'t last more then 3 months, very slow then all of a sudden it would not turn on. package showed up on time and the phone worked great and still does except the battery doesn\\'t stay charged too long but i have not seen one of these phones that do. can\\'t complain about the price either. just a great phone- im so happy and so is my princess great phone bought this for a friend was great she loves it i\\'ve never seen her so excited. excellent! thanks! this was one of the most iconic and sought-after smartphones in the early 21st century. the sidekick was an exclusive for t-mobile and was so cool that it made you want to switch your carrier just to experience its coolness. however, now the software is defunct and no longer supported as stated by microsoft. i would suggest maybe purchasing this for someone who\\'s in desperate need for a phone, but that can deal without cool features such as watching videos on youtube, video chatting, or popular apps, as the phone could never do that when it initially released. the phone is quite gorgeous regardless and it still looks pretty rad considering its age. it has a nice and spacious qwerty keyboard that makes texting and possibly emailing a sinch! it also has a trackball (that lights up to your liking) and trackpad for easy navigation. the phone makes amazing sound effects as you scroll across the home and when you press the back button and whatnot. it\\'s quite outdated, but this phone still has appeal despite it\\'s lack of features that every phone today has. everything in low cost. nice look. works great.this is samsung\\'s hidden gem. i can say this is the perfect phone for low cost. its great!!! this is slightly different than the s7, negatives are no built in compass so it can\\'t sense which way your headed unless the gps is on and you\\'re moving, no light meter so it has to use the camera, so automatic screen brightening and dimming is non-existent. on the plus side, i believe the screen is slightly bigger than the s7, it has a built in fm radio and the headphone jack is on the bottom. think about it, you look at your phone, then put it in your pocket upside down, so a bottom jack makes all kinds of sense.i haven\\'t done many pics yet with the camera, but it is inferior to the camera in the note 4 which was so awesome it made me forget i wanted a \"real\" camera.if you drive for uber and lyft, this has no issues running both apps and gps at the same time. just make sure you have a phone charger that can stay on top of the power draw. using a usb cable and the usb jack in my sonata, the battery slowly lost level.i mounted mine using a magnetic mount ac clip so it\\'s being cooled all day as i drive and there are no overheating issues from running gps, both apps and pandora. because there is no light meter, i must occasionally refresh the screen brightness on my own as i have yet to find an app that automatically polls the camera every minute or two to refresh screen brightness. at just over $200 (usd), this was well worth the money! amazing, very easy to use and even with its small size the keyboard is very responsive. i love it! this phone is awesome! as far as i can tell it works just fine. i had ordered one before just like it, but sent it back because some of the letters on the keyboard didn\\'t respond when you pushed them. return was super easy, and now i have this one, and i love it! i was trying to be price conscious but it ended up costing me more money in the end. the screen felt cheap and when it did a system upgrade it stopped working on my network. i could not get the phone to recognize my sim card. i am very tech savy and nothing worked. the screen doesn\\'t respond very well to my touch not even a stylus helps. it took me abnormally long to send a text: between the phone guessing the opposite of what i was trying to text and or the horrible lagging it was unbearable. if you don\\'t text much or are a slow texter this phone would work for you but it drove me crazy. i purchased a 5.5 blu phone and i love it. blu does make great phone just not this one. finally a phone that works it doesn\\'t have the choice to change the lenguages. only works in english, chinese everything as expected a little bit dirty box and a european charger but all the rest is ok no good idea get it this cell phone the touch screan glass is broke very dissatisfied not recommend to buying. use phone. amazing product condition. excelent wow! this phone is amazing for the price paid. easy to use with many amazing features. very goob i am kind of not sure about the product. i received a charger (the plug i mean) which is not us compatible?? looking forward for an answer from the seller. i thought it was decent until i sneezed with the phone in my hand and now i have a crack across the middle of the screen this phone is worth every penny. the new galaxy s5 costs more than i was willing to pay for a phone so i opted on the s4 with the manufacture\\'s warranty. it is very easy to set up and operate, in fact this is an excellent phone for dummies like me who are new to this technology. i would recommend this phone to anyone, but be sure to purchase an otter case to protect your investment! i like! my first impressions for this phone is pretty good. i\\'m happy to see the amount of flagship phone qualities that this packs for under $300. i previously had the samsung galaxy s4 and i’m happy with the switch so far. i’m loving the 5.5 inch screen for browsing the web or watching videos although it’s going to take some time for me to adjust to the size of the phone. the dual facing front speakers are great, it’s much louder and clearer than the s4’s speaker. the near stock android user interface was nice and smooth with some lag when opening up new applications. however, there are some problems that keeps this phone away from getting a 5 star rating. the power button is placed too high to operate without adjusting your hands and i thought that the double tap to power feature would help alleviate this problem but it doesn’t work most of the time when the screen is off. one more problem is the video recording quality looks low quality, during playback it’s like watching 360p or 480p videos that is scaled up to 1080p. these problems can probably be fixed with new updates, but until then i’ll leave the rating at a 4 star for now. here are some other pros and cons.pros:- bright and clear display- great dual front facing speakers- pretty smooth user interface- good reception (i had no issues connecting this phone with the at&t network)- camera takes decent pictures for the price- slim body- reversible screen and call featurecons:- power button placement- double tap power feature is unreliable at times (subject to change)- poor quality 1080p video recording (subject to change)- some lag when opening application- lack of ir blaster- non user replaceable battery- radio feature gets terrible receptionother note:- the phone call sound effect volume gradually gets lower when you call someone. i don’t know if this is intentional or a defective speaker. however, when the person answers their phone the volume seemed fine throughout the call. great phone. happy with my purchase. camera is great and lots of customization options. too much hurt on the bottom, very upset. perfect phone for my son. he had an iphone 5 but it was acting up. he needed a new phone but the iphone 7 is too expensive. he mainly uses the phone for texting and downloading games. we figured it\\'s a great deal. and it is. he loves it. the phone will not stay on. it continues to reboot itself. when i contacted the seller they were not helpful. i an currently doing a a-z claim to try and resolve this matter. the samsung mini only work for one week it was good for one week then it just died won\\'t turn on wont charge i got a refund from amazon because the seller wasn\\'t any help at all great phone. i always loved htc phones and this one didnt disappoint. the speed, it doesnt get hot, superb camera with wonderful manual settings, and a strong build. only thing is that the g4 has a better camera...... but thats ok. we really liked the phone that we received as good as the samsung note 3 for my purposes i love being able to recharge my battery on the go and not need to rely on being next to an outlet all the time. i rely on my phone and always cut it close at the end of the with battery life so i was always it would die on my way home. it is durable but slick which makes it difficult to grip at times. i\\'ve dropped it a couple times so far but it\\'s held up great so far. i am terrified however about scratching the screen as there is no screen protector included. excellent and everything in order good i only had it for less than a week, but i\\'m really digging this phone. it\\'s my first smart phone, so i\\'m not speaking with tons of experience.there is a bunch of bloatware on this phone. i installed the zergrush root:(...)and then titanium back-up app which allows backing-up to the sd card and removal of all the crap.worked great. still exploring all the capabilities this phone has.the voice recognition seems to work really well. i\\'ve used it a few times with the google search function when i didn\\'t feel like typing.it has locked-up once while surfing the web which required a battery pull. re-booted with no ill-effects.a primary attraction to this phone was the availability of t-mobile\\'s $30/mo 100 min/unlimited text and data plan. i wanted a smart phone on a monthly plan, but not the typical $70/mo charge you\\'ve got with a contract. for me, this is an ideal package as i\\'m not a big talker.that being said, read the fine print. this plan is only available via walmart and t-mobile.com. the catch is that going through either of these sources makes it difficult or impossible to port your old number.to activate my phone, i called t-mobile\\'s porting resolution number at 877-789-3106. they activated my phone and ported my old number, but then despite my request, set me up with the $50/mo unlimited plan. i had to call customer service and do some arm twisting to get on the \"walmart plan\".in hindsight, it may have been easier to have paid an extra 10 bucks and bought the phone from walmart.8/8/2012 update:this sucker runs hot. gets pretty warm while websurfing and streaming. gets scalding hot while running navigation. it\\'s locked up a few times while running navigation. pretty much the worst time to have to shut down and restart your phone (while driving).this last time when trying to restart, i got a message stating the battery was too hot, or something to that effect. i\\'ve started removing the case when using the navigation.i\\'m pretty sure these symptoms are leading up to premature battery failure. time will tell. might try a different case to alleviate the issue.other than that, i\\'m really happy with the phone.7/22/14 update:final update. i dumped this phone about 6 months ago. it began to crash, restart and just plain shut down indiscriminately. part of the problem may have been the sd card, it just didn\\'t have the processing power to handle anything but the simplest apps. biggest offender might be the latest facebook updates. any gps app also will freeze it up instantly. my wife still has her phone of the same model, and we\\'re getting ready to dump it too for the same issues.this model it just plain obsolete in 2014, and i would not recommend purchasing one at any price. it worked marginally well for the first six months, but after that, it became a turd.the good news is my new moto x works awesome and i was able to seamlessly transfer my $30/mo 4g plan. perfect, just what i ordered! brand new in a box with all accesories. very very bad experience , my phone is not working well from beginning. talked to samsung canada and usa . they said warranty is not covered in north america and this phone is having technical difficulties from beginning. also ime number on the phone is not valid for north america as per samsung support dept.be careful before buying anything from this seller. pvcs......?????????? not helpful to customers i really loved this cellphone this phone is brilliant, not sure why they haven\\'t launched it in europe - i think it would do incredibly well! excellent gsm unlocked, bought when in the us and brought over to thailand for main usage. everything is as listed on description- what was expected of samsung galaxy. i thought it was also great that it came with a uk adapter plug. the best personal phone has i spectated. i don\\'t have complain. still working.but the phone size is to big. the perfect phone. hope it lasts for 50 years. this phone is advertised as a touchscreen and it isnt...it also does not charge all the way and shuts its self off when i am using it. i also got a refurbished phone when i paid for a brand new one. by the time i got my phone, the last day to return it was here and i could not return it so now i am stuck with it. i ordered this device to replace a broken phone. the phone i received was defective. it would not accept my old sim card, not would it accept a new one i picked up at the at&t store. no matter what you put in, it says \"no sim\". do not buy. had no problem using this under metro pcs. stay away of this phone stop working after month 1/2 waste of money!!! i was a bit skeptical when i was purchasing this phone but now i\\'m 100% satisfied. this is a genuine phone and it comes with all accessories. it performs perfectly and so far i can\\'t complain about anything. thanks wireless place for your excellent service i returned this phone for the following reasons. first, the wifi would stall constantly. it would show connected, but would would send or receive no data until i toggled wifi off and then back on. happened all the time. it was maddening. and it happened on any wifi network i was connected to. didn\\'t matter if i changed from 2 to 5 ghz, or if i had the phone keep wifi on all the time in the wifi settings. second, the phone wouldn\\'t remember accessibility settings. i use greenify and clean master. both of those apps have advanced features that need to be enabled under accessibility settings. the phone wouldn\\'t remember these settings. i had to toggle them on numerous times per day. finally, the fingerprint scanner works, but it only worked on the first attempt maybe 1/3 of the time. your finger needs to be on there just right.again, not hating on this phone. i liked it. it\\'s solid build and good battery life. screen is magnificent and it\\'s fast. but because it\\'s a blu phone, i know that they will never update the software and i\\'d be stuck with these annoyances as long as i own the phone, and i\\'m not willing to do that. if this device ever gets updated to marshmallow, i will consider purchasing again. so far, i am extremely happy with this phone. micro sim card is a little tricky to install. you have to flip up the silver metal sim card slot to place sim card in and snap back down. then lock into place. i could not! find any kind of instructions what so ever on this... not even on youtube. phone is nice size, thin, very responsive, great color and economically priced. i got the pink that came with pink cover. i bought this phone as a gift for someone not very familiar with smartphones; i knew it was a cheap device so i did not expect fancy screens or impressive features, but i thought it would make a good entry-level phone.the phone is good looking and nicely packed, and it was relatively easy to use. not too bad for the price.the downside, it died after 6 months of very light use. we turned the phone off and left it charging during the night, by morning the device was super-hot and would not turn on. we let it cool down, tried again several times with no luck, removed the battery, tried charging again, you name it. no luck at all.the phone is officialy a papaer weight now.... i have to set somethang heavy on the charger to charge my phone n it dies to quick nowhere did the description say the phone was a refurb. i turned on service and got texts for someone else. also everything was in spanish! i needed a translator to change the options!ive had prepaid service 1 day and its crashing. i can\\'t go on the app store. and my balance is $0 after refilling 50$ this afternoon. i\\'ve done nothing!hoping it straightens out. i convinced my husband to switch to blackberry. in compelled to write a review. i read them consistently, but never write them. you\\'d never know this phone wasn\\'t brand new. my daughter was ecstatic and i saved a lot of money. delivery was fast as always. came with earbuds and charger and packaging looked exactly like new iphone. loved it!! great a marvel coolest nice phone its very handy the reception is good not bad for basic phone. nice phone got one for my mom. mom doesn\\'t need a compass. i was pleasantly surprised by the quality (in a good way). mom loves the phone! loved the phone. feels good in hand compared to nexus 5 . you can see and feel quality. loved the notifications, and the voice control is the best i\\'ve seen. photos has bluish tint, but it doesn\\'t matter for me. excellent buy, speedy delivery, item as described, brand new and sealed in box. my daughter was thrilled and started to use it immediately. it worked great! review is for shipping and the product. shipping was perfect, the product was brand new as promised. i love this phone. i wish the battery lasted a little longer but it\\'s a great size for me and the pecfect price. i would never know this was used and reconditioned! this samsung looks brand new! it came in it\\'s original box with the phone wrapped up. great presentation. the phone was already charged so i could start using it as soon as i added my sim card! much better than my s4. extremly happy with my phone seller maintained communication description was exact received in a timely manner my little grand son love it. everything went fast, just the way was pictured. best seller. thank you georgeta i had to go pick from a u.p.s office the iphone is not factory unlocked as advertised really slow but it reliable my experience was great , the phone was in good condition. actually what i expected. i would definitely recommend to others the phone works perfectly, works good with venezuelan networks (haven\\'t tested it with digitel yet). awesome device, fast, and everything that it\\'s supposed to do. originally this product received a 5 star rating from me,that is until 8 months later and the charging port decides to not take a charge anymore. i am past the window for return for an obvious defect in the manufacturing of the product and am very upset. the product didn\\'t even last a full year before breaking down. would never purchase again and offer this as a future buyer beware for anyone interested in these phones the phone is fully functional and isn\\'t scratched on the front or anything, so it\\'s perfect if you are looking for an htc incredible.that said, on the back cover of one of the phones (i bought 2) the shiny plastic \"htc\" logo was missing the ht, so i pulled out the c and it looks like nothing is missing. one of the phones came with a wall adapter for the usb cable, and the other did not.as for the phone it\\'s self, it is a bit outdated so some newer apps may not work, but it is quick and outright awesome. i would look up more thorough reviews if you aren\\'t sure if an incredible is right for you, but if it is, then this is definitely the one to buy. going to war? don\\'t forget your otter box.the screen protector adds some resistance that i don\\'t like. i may remove it. otherwise solid overall. i really like the cover and integral kickstand. this specific phone is very reliable, affordable, and easy to use. it is a good size as well, not too big-not too small. the charger never worked everything is perfect it works on ecaudor!!!! to used in the usa is horrible... beats all android cheap phones. functions adequately. i did not get what is shown in the picture. the picture shows an otterbox clip. i just got a flimsy clip. this phone is awesome, ive had allot of phones but this one is by far the best ive ever had, i owned the nokia 1020 and k zoom cause the camera on a phone is the most important feature, i loved both of those phones but this one is far better, the video\\'s this phone produces are beautiful, if you were to buy this phone just for being a camera you will be extremely pleased, also the specs are good enough to play any game the android market has available, also the body of this phone is very nice, removable back plate for swapping battery, and metal frame are awesome, only negatives with this phone are no memory card slot and no optical stabilization. if you wish to see the video quality for yourself click the link below for my youtube channel.https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plnww7mkp6towfeuo_vrsktwcun5b2hxqc this phone is one of samsungs best product yet iphone,nokia, illumina, htc or anyother android phone can not compare loving it exito the product is excellent and the response by the seller is quite fast and effective, i recommend one hundred percent good phone. be careful when buying a case for this phone. i really love this phone, i am going to buy another one for a back up. great phone! great amazing! got an iphone 5c that looks like a brand new phone! we had one small issue with the charger, but customer service was awesome and got the problem taken care of immediately. they were very nice and beyond helpful. this is the second phone we have gotten and they have both been amazing! would definitely reccommend this to anybody! this phone is great went from a note 4 which was also a great phone but after 2 years started to crap out on me. for only a $400 price tag this phone is definitely worth considering and rivals alongside the other flagship devices such as the iphone 6s or samsung galaxy s7 edge. this phone works phenomenally and i have yet to experience any lag. i don\\'t know why all the tech reviewers are ragging on the camera when the outstanding photos, albeit low light is quite noisy. i also love the dash charging as i am able to get up in the morning do my routine and leave my phone charging for 30 minutes and have 90% battery and be ready to go about my day. i highly recommend this device. only bad thing about this product was that it did not come with a factory usb samsung cable. it was some kind of vietnam made cable, and rather than charge my phone, it would have the lightning bolt like it was charging, but it absolutely would not charge. i had to charge it in my car last night to get my phone to charge. other than that, phone works pretty well best phone ever! it is a beautiful phone, works like it is supposed too, and has a nice premium weight to it. i will be returning for the blu life one, however, i am a satisfied customer. youtube does crash from time to time and games are slow but those are not complaints just observations. two out of 3 phones i purchased has already stopped working and its been only 4 months and they will not help. i was sold a failed unlock phone that was no longer compatible with sprint. not only this but the device arrived greasy and dirty. when using headphones in this phone the right ear doesn\\'t work! phones is nice otherwise tho. what can be done to fix this? very good excellent the best phone i ever own, i watch a lot of videos on it. it came so fast i was surprised. i even bought one for my hubby and he blaggs about it to his friends. i simply love this phone. this company rocks! it arrived in 24hr! great servic, great packaging, brand new, no problems! i highly recommend this to all! good phone but battery is dieing really quick i was a little skeptical about buying electronics online especially a phone, i hesitated whether or no i should buy it but i\\'m glad i did it was in perfect condition and the exact same model as described very happy with my purchase. good this phone does everything that i want my phone to and then some. don\\'t expect a flagship phone like apple products or samsung, but instead expect a well equipped phone for under 150. i have had this for a week and i can say that i love it more than i did my galaxy s4 active. the screen is beautiful, the design and feel are great, the size is on our with a note 4, i can\\'t complain about the speeds or connections, and the battery life is great.obviously you do lose some features, by none of the features lost are things that i really miss anyways. the camera is a little slow to focus, but the picture quality is great. it takes a little getting used to not having some sort of button on the devices screen, but now that i am i don\\'t see any reason for the extra buttons.i would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a long life, easy to use, beautiful looking and functioning smart phone for under 150. just bought the htc one m7 \"new\" from buyme llc and it clearly isn\\'t new. the screen is slightly damaged, the bottom left of it is slightly elevated above the frame as if something didn\\'t snap into place, and the original packaging differs from what i\\'ve seen in un-boxing videos, in fact, it came with a windows phone booklet instead of an android one. also, the earbuds seem very used, the paint on them is worn and both buds show that they are for the right ear. the screen is incredible. like really incredible. the resolution is better than my eye can see. i use a galaxy s4 as my regular phone and it has great resolution where you can\\'t see individual pixels. i thought the s4 screen was as good as you can get, but the s6 screen takes it to a whole new level. even though you can\\'t see pixels on either screen, the higher resolution of the s6 screen makes everything look so sharp that it\\'s nearly impossible to tell you are looking at a screen. it\\'s that incredible.the design of the phone just feels more \\'expensive\\'. i mean that in a good way. it feels just higher quality than previous models in the galaxy s line. the s3 and s4 for example are often critiqued for having a plastic shell. the s6 has a metal band around the outside that just makes it feel \\'premium\\' in your hand. it should also provide more protection for the device as well.touchwiz is heavily scaled back. i hate touchwiz (samsung\\'s version of android) it adds a layer of ui that is neither helpful nor intuitive. and it\\'s a resource hog which slows the phone down for important tasks just so it can make the scrolling smoother, and other such useless tradeoffs. on the s6 touchwiz was barely noticeable. the ui looks more like the standard google android lollipop interface. it was all just much smoother and simpler and better and wonderful. i finally ended up going with the s6 since it seems like the usability rating was much higher and i didn\\'t want to end up being an apple fanboy.. check out that site if you want to see the different phone models in a side by side comparison. works perfect for telcel gsm!! (mexico) phone looks great as a refurbished, almost as new 98% let me just say that this came so quick it was crazy. i wasn\\'t expecting it so soon. it was bigger than i thought, but it\\'s a really flattering phone. it works wonderfully! thanks so much! love my phone . it was used but it look brand new! the only thing i wasn\\'t impressed with is that she sent me fake iphone headsets but that\\'s okay. overall great seller. i recommend this seller. @sharri international inc \\'i got the green one \\' if i there\\'s an option for no star rating, i will do it for this lousy phone for couples of reasons. it\\'s a brand-new factory unlocked phone that i purchase less than 2 weeks ago. it works as supposed for the first few days but shows signs of un-stability in the second week. sometimes i have to press the home button twice to make it work. when i surf web on safari, the screen does not rotate anymore! i\\'m coordinating with the seller to get it return now. compared to a nokia 925 that i have been using for over a year, iphone 6 plus is suck. exelente as advertised very satisfied with product. love it well, not much to say about samsung product in general. i have been using samsung product for a long time and i like it. the initial price for unlocked phone is too expensive, but if you stay for about two months and price always drops at least by $200.00. however, it cost less compared to unlocked iphone. excelent i bought 2 of these and still trying to figure out how to use them and all it came when was a little piece of paper for instructions! i even had my phone company look at it and they couldnt get it to work!! all good terrible phone. cheaply made, hard to hear anyone and it stopped working after 30 days. don\\'t waste your money. good todo perfectamente bien.. recomendado 100% hi everyone,i would \\'ve given -ve rating if it\\'s possible. i ordered a new unlocked nokia phone from this seller and what i received was totally surprising. first of all it was not an unlocked phone instead it was an at&t phone which was in a contract period. moreover they send the phone inside an plastic envelop with a duplicate battery charger, apparently without any accessories and manuals.i contacted the seller for the refund then he started giving excuses like you should \\'ve read the details. it was clearly mentioned on amazon that its a new and unlocked phone with all accessories. somehow i was able to convince him for the refund and shipped the phone back to the seller\\'s address given by the seller himself.its been more than three months now and i didnt even get a penny back. the seller is saying that he didnt receive it back however i confirmed from the shipping company that it was delivered on the destination on time.i lost my money and still didnt get the phone i ordered. i had to order another phone from some other seller.so guys think twice before you even visit this seller\\'s page on amazon. friendly advice to all of you find some other seller. trust me you dont wanna get into this kinda mess !! i hope this review would save atleast some customers from this seller. excellent phone. it good compared to my 2 year old htc phone, this one is night and day. works great, lots of memory, and the speakers in the front makes listening to applications much better. i was able to install all my apps that were on my old phone and much more. now the biggest surprise has been the battery life. my old phone would be out of juice with any intensive app use or by the end of the day if i was lucky. i actually went two days without charging and it still had battery charge. very happy and highly recommend. excelente good thanks it is an amazing phone please do not buy these phones as they will not last long. i bought 3 of them and all of them stop functioning within 3 months of use. excellent! very reliable. good easy phone to use. not full of technology but served it\\'s purpose. this phone was stolen, but workd great for the time i had it. really big upgrade from my old and slow galaxy s3. i did have to go to t-mobile to get a nano sim card though. but they did it for free. i don\\'t use it much and the battery life is at 90% at the end of the day. however i noticed on days where i used google maps as a gps in the car for a couple hours, it was already almost out of battery. i like android because it\\'s easy to work with on my computer. i just put an mp3 on it to use as my ringtone. the fingerprint scanner thing on the back works well and is in a comfortable spot. i love.. it to the max! excellent product ty worked for 11 weeks surprisingly good quality phone considering the low price compared to other phones. have had it for over a week and dropped it twice and did not break or scratch. has a decent amount of space with options to upgrade. able to play all my games without any lag and plenty of room on the screen to see everything. this item does not work with iphone. nor can you download any app for the phone to work. this phone is awesome!!!. does practically the same thing most high end expensive phone would do for a very low cost!! i tuned on the phone initially was bright and the picture quality great but could be a bit brighter for when you are in the sunlight out doors. very light weight.texture at back of phone has a nice feel. speakers are loud enough for music but not while on a phone call. does not come with earphones which was my disappointment; only the phone, the battery and a charger. have to charge battery every night though. the battery goes down quickly if your doing lots of stuff and have apps running. fully charged within 3-4 hrs. fairly fast to fit your speed but is more efficient when you boost the phone or clear the cache or ram. needs additional memory for music and pics so a sd memory card would be good. got the phone everything lg was expected. the battery doesn\\'t last at all. its terrible. also the phone stays hot like a damn samsung phone would. had a great lg phone b4 decided to stick with a lg. the back of the phone is burning up hot. you can barely touch the volume, power button. i say look into the g4 or g5 lg i was replacing a lost 4s and this was exactly the thing i needed. good description and the unit performs well. got as a replacement for a galaxy sii- absolutely worth it. great phone! bought it for my mom and she loves it!! dependable seller!! everything works well phone looks almost brand new however i recieved the wrong charger port. blackberry curve 9360 unlocked quad-band 3g gsm phone with 5mp camera, qwerty keyboard, gps and wi-fi - us warranty - blacklamento decir que mi experiencia con este vendedor fue muy mala. pésimo producto. recibí teléfono bloqueado.solamente en idioma inglés generó gastos extras (venezuela).sus sellos estaban violentados. parecía reparado previamente. it is just as fast and good as my friends\\' samsung galaxy s6s. great price for a quality phone. didn\\'t work well with my phone. ever since i have had the note 4, i experience random crashes and rebooting. it does not matter what time of day or what application i am using. it crashes and automatically reboots. since i am in it i have waited patiently for a firmware fix. i figured there had to be one. after more than 6 months i have not been able to find a fix!.has anyone else had this problem? if so, were you able to fix? excellent my teenage daughter had just received this phone for her birthday in march and recently lost it. this is exact phone. good i originally purchased good phone does everything a smartphone should . so nice phone and very cheap i have had this product for a month and a half and it stopped working. start up screen and that\\'s it. i was pleased but now am not because it\\'s brand new and stopped working. phone was advertised as new, but was defective. took it to the apple store and they said it came up on their computer as recycled. hmmmm am having to return it. camera broke 3 week after i got the phone. nnice product, i would recommend. good phone so far no problems!! my husband is not a technogeek. this phone is what he wants. i got it for father\\'s day, and it arrived on time. i have not used it yet, but the seller sent me information on what to do if i have any problems. sure it will be better than the five year old phone he has now. excelent i am so dissapointed in this product.this phone refused to work in december this year.i am crushed.i wish i could get a refund.i will never buy anything electronic online.i live in trinidad,west indies phone was exactly how it was described this watch is great. i have all the samsung watches and i love them all. beyond what i expected, all friends and family would like to own a device as this one but due to price change the decided not to buy.device looks like a iphone 6 plus, battery life is awesome, picture are clear not as sharp. the batery is now starting to give problems! purchased as a christmas gift for my boyfriend. definitely a step up from his iphone 4s. did not have any problems getting it activated by verizon. works beautifully. phone keep stating no sim card,when card was put in;card from at&t gsm used.will return. i had the s4 and i thought it was the best phone i ever had, wowo this s5 is much more nicer. i love the futures it came withi have no issues whatsoever. for the price i think it was cool i bought this cell like 3 weeks ago and is acting weird already, it erases my contacts all the time, sometimes won\\'t let me send messages and the it won\\'t let me make calls. i had to buy another cell. i hated the sidekick. oh yeah and the internet does not work at all!!! love the phone. it exceeded my expectations with only one day of use my cell damage the screen i did an excellent purchase about, a great phone and the best and faster shipping!im from venezuela and it works perfectly with 3g network, just teel to h&p that provides a 1,2 and 6 bands for movistar cause bands 1, 4 and 8 just works with digitel it was slow not what i expected small screen operating system sucked couldnt do much with it i needed a simple but uesful phone. if you don\\'t need a smart phone but one that is waht phones were ment to be this one is good. unless you have very small hands, don\\'t even think about getting this. i had to return this item because after charging it for 7 hours afterni got it, it wasn\\'t charging at all! not to have any issues whatsoever, i decided to return it instead. i guess thats the price you pay. i like it bought this item for my younger sister in guyana, yeah another country and she loves it. she\\'s been texting me ever since. great device hopefully, the iphone user in my house will not destroy his iphone with this case. love the fit and the look. great value for the price! excellent, very good excelente this phone does everything i want it to and more. full anndroid market access. built in gps. screen size is good and all apps run smoothly. well worth the money. great phone... battery was half full, like always with these things, put in my tmobile sim card and it worked right away.. its exactly the same size as my s1, which is what i wanted. absolutely adore this phone, however i dropped it the 2 week i had it and cracked the screen. :(the sound is great! and the camera came with cool beauty tool and pose thing. i greatly enjoy using the cameras. the phone arrived on time. works great. my teenage daughter is happy. what else can i say...also a great price. its good, just doesn\\'t connect to bluetooth headphones great this doesnt come with headphones the phone i purchased is replacing my old one. i am happy to have ordered through you, getting it on time before thanksgiving..it works very well, and performs buch better than my old bb.thank you for the good service as a low cost smartphone you can\\'t go wrong with this device, since it a motorola you will get the latest os updates fairly quickly and the battery last all day. good battery lift. bought it for my daughter and she is very happy with the phone.good build quality. the shipping was very fast! i bought this for a friend who has a plan for no smart phones....works like a champ! so far a good phone, my daughter broke her other phone, did want to buy an expensive phone yet, so i brought this one and she loves it, she did say the camera was not that good buy overall it\\'s good for a teenager. excellent for texting! like that the front is touch! very wide screen and neat layout! has excellent speaker and clear. have bought few of this phones recently. first of all was pleased by ergonomic, second surprise was touch screen... i\\'ve been an user of 5800 for quiet long time and i hated its touch screen, nokia was always bad with touches. when i switched to iphone i have realized how much i was suffering from it. but this phone is another story, it actually responds with 99% precision to your touch. nice screen with good font size. camera is ok though i prefer cameras on se. but the most amazing thing about this phone is a price! for 139$ this is a steal! you get nice looking phone with 3,5g wi-fi and 5mpx camera with touch screen on top of it.must have! works very good for what i need it for . yessur i\\'m still trying to figure out how to download music up on my phone.. can anyone help me with that??? outside of that the phone is great it\\'s a good phone. i had big problems with the tune in app for windows. there was no toggle to move to place in recorded programs, and if there was a streaming issue, the program would reset to the beginning with no way to bring it back to where i was. eventually, i brought back my fire phone back into service with a renewed appreciation of what it provided. a great buy. a good working phone. i loved the plum color. it was a christmas gift for a family member and so so good it works well, but i can\\'t eliminate the advertisement that i don\\'t use verizone. i think that they have unblocked the cellphone but not 100% good. another good protective case for my cell from otterbox. bought this one for the belt clip.nice and at a good price. the only lacking thing is front camera ! rest, perfect !! ideal for the islands came to me with the home button broken and had many problems with trying to charge the phone fixed that 30$ later and has now just broke after 4 months of use. was not dropped or treated badly in anyway es bien wife uses it every day and carries it on all trips from home. still going strong! bought it for my wife. she dropped it in the toilet and we cleaned it up with alcohol and sticking it in rice. the dual sim is a cool feature but you have to set up everything each time. we use it for the bvi between the usvi and the vpn has to be put in now and then this seller has outstanding professionalism. he went above and beyond to deliver a great product to me. the only flaw in this item was the description said it has a front facing camera, and it doesn\\'t. but i enjoyed my buying experience and no doubt i would recommend this seller to anyone seeking an affordable smart phone. perhaps because i used a htc butterfly before using this phone, i found this phone significantly underpowered... the phone finds it hard to keep up with my multi-tasking demands. but for a phone this cheap, i\\'d rather say it is a relatively good buy. if you\\'re looking for a phone at a low price, i would definitely suggest this phone because it does quite well for it\\'s price point. excelent the best phone ever made awesome would recomend back in march of this year i submitted a wonderful review about the seller and the fact that my product was shipped so quickly. however, and unfortunately for me the phone itself died a few weeks ago. and on my birthday no less! i\\'ve already bought new batteries and a desktop battery charger and it is still acting wonky. sigh...all i wanted was a working droid. i got a lifeless hand ornament. thanks a lot! never...again... great phone! nice but sometimes it\\'s too slow. i do not know if these reviews are seller specific but i order the phone from \"next level mobile\" which was labeled as \"new\" after around 3.5 months the display was not working, when i brought it to apple they said they could not fix the problem because it has been replaced with a \"third party display\". i bought my htc 8x new from a retail seller on amazon. it was new and unopened. however, after 4 months, the three buttons on the bottom stopped functioning. i have never dropped it and always take great care of it. i thought htc has good quality, but this happened within 4 months! so i sent it back to htc and provided all receipts to proof that i only had this for 4 months, htc still wants to charge me since htc does not cover phones not purchased from amazon. be aware of it! it may stop function in a short time, and if you are going to buy it from any other sellers , check with them first to see if your phone is covered with warrantee. great ítem! like new i tried a few that were okay. after reading the reviews , i chose this cute case and i love it.it fits perfectly, my phone is protected and it\\'s really pretty. excelent!!! totally fake product. samsung logo wasn\\'t there on phone. the phone started freezing the very same day. the video gives xray effect in all video and camera. camera freezes every time. no way looks an original phone. returned the product. muy bien gracias. haven\\'t activated this phone yet, as it is a christmas gift, but the phone is in great condition (as described). so far, i am extremely satisfied with this purchase. will update this review, if it is necessary.update: we absolutely love this phone and i am very satisfied with the purchase. my friend love his phone excellent recommend 100% excelent good phone. no complaints so far. could easily be a five i like the set up of this phone, the touch buttons on the face of the phone make it easy to navigate. i wish it was a little thinner i am happy about the purchase i only have a couple of downfalls. one is i didnt kno the phone was so small,from the pictures and actually looking at it on youtube and stuff it looked bigger. it came with everything it suppose to. the sony xperia is a practical and modern phone. i like it because have a perfect size and wide. i recomended it i\\'ll be the first 2-star review. this is definitely a bare-bones basic phone. but if a phone has a camera, i expect that i should be able to send picture texts. i got this to replace another nokia phone. i figured since this was a newer model, it should have picture message capabilities. not so!! no picture texts, and to me that is a basic functionality. other than that, it\\'s a decent phone. but i\\'m sending it back because i can\\'t live without picture texts. it was a great phone too bad it got stolen from my purse at waltmart the next day :( good phone.. owner is berry happy... can no complaing phone is decent. however the os tweaks that htc has done to it have made it less accessible. i bought it for my wife for ease of use it supposedly had. she has had a difficult time with it. one example is the fact you have to press and hold the #1 digit to access voicemail. completely unintuitive! in retrospect i should have gotten her a samsung which has a much better layout without the worthless multi feed interface. only reason i did not score it lower was the hardware quality is excellent. lovely phone does everything i needs it to do. great price & it works with my t-mobile sim card. i had 2 phones from t-mobile and they were very defective had to be replaced 3 times & same result. i\\'ll never buy any phone from t-mobile ever again. i was so amazed from the time i purchased this blu phone. it\\'s amazing what this phone can do & it is very high tech. i am very pleased. i had a htc one before the m8. it is lightning fast, latest android version, incredible display, incredible camera, battery lasts 3 days using always 3g (no wi-fi)!! my \"iphone\" friends were very impressed. very well finished. the phone is great for the price. great phone and fast shipping we received the phones extremely fast. they work fine with straight talk. everything went smoothly to add them to the account. i did have to have straight talk walk me through how to change a setting to be able to send picture messages, but it was very easy. we love the phones. we chose these over the iphone s3 because of the functions we wanted on it. we can skype with the front facing camera. the calendar, e-mail, etc. sync just fine. has tons of fun features to make using it easy. overall we are very happy with this purchase and the seller. does this phone s6 g920l work in trinidad and tobago ? i have used it for a month. it turned out to be a real revolution! this is the first time i use samsung smartphone and i feel it is a wise choice. get compliments all the time great blackberry s m a r t p h o n e 8 5 2 0 at a reasonable cost. #name? i love apple, just not this particular phone, it worked for a day and then when i would make or receive calls i would here a terrible noise. this phone started off great but considering where i am now, great meant that it functioned properly. i gone through two of these phones, neither of which worked properly. the first started out okay but the battery saver glitched the ui to oblivion so i did what any rational human being and returned it requesting a new one.the second time, i saw the replacement arrive in the mail. i was happy, finally a phone to replace my aging nokia 822. it started out as one glitch, the battery saver and that\\'s it. it was not as severe as the last one so i didn\\'t worry. now though, in the past two day this waste of money has started glitching all over again, doing nothing like it is supposed to. it is sending multiple text messages to my contacts, not receiving messages, ui glitching out.don\\'t waste your time with this phone this is one of the zippiest and smoothest working windows phones. it is obviously not the best phone out there, but it is great nonetheless. the major issues, as many will attest, are with the recent bout of windows updates that vary in effectiveness. however, after testing windows 10 on a few low-end devices, the 950 is leaps and bounds better! i wanted a cheap fitness tracker with clock.the bad: the pedometer said unavailable, the sleep tracker said unavailable, and i could only find the sedentary alert once- don\\'t know if that worked.the middle: the band on it is huge. i\\'m a big girl that usually uses extra links in a watch, and i was on the second to last hole here. it\\'s thicker and heavier than i expected, but i think i would get used to it.the good: even though i didn\\'t want to connect it to my phone, it connected easily to my iphone 6. i could get my music, even though it wasn\\'t very loud. i liked the idea of an fm radio. even though the headphones didn\\'t fit, good sound quality. excellent enjoying my phone! great 2g in t-mobile excellent camera stopped working on the second day after release and simply states \"unfortunately the camera has stopped working\". a quick google search revealed this is a common problem with sony phones.on 8/11/2016 another update was released and now bluetooth doesn\\'t connect.i am using the ultra with t-mobile usa. the phone had no problem connecting to the network once the sim card was inserted but it takes for ever to initiate the call. after dialing a number or selecting a contact to call it takes a good 10-20 seconds for the dial tone to start. these calls are made in a major city and i have never had this problem with other cell phones.coming from a note 5, the screen quality isn\\'t the best. i was willing to sacrifice resolution for size but at this point i regret the purchase. i will be returning this phone due too all the problems. i wish there was more storage, but what i can say is that i really like this phone. pictures are great! i have had it now for about 4 months and am very satisfied. it is just like the galaxy everybody is going crazy over, i think the 5s or something. whatever it is my sister has it, only i paid alot less for mine! muy bien it\\'s perfect!!! fantastic phone and fantastic dealer. thanks!! great for the money. big screen size and performance. more of the same and for a very high price... everything good i have purchased 30 cell phones...they dont reach my expectations for variuos reasons such as dont take sim cards, came with missing patrs( batteries, back covers, screen, booklets,charchers.) and i want to return them i is a nightmate..process is taking for ever. it was very nice and it looks like it came with a brand new charger and headphones! awesome and thank you! this phone literally fell out of my lap and the screen shutoff completely.definitely not worth it apparently even with the low price.it\\'s great that my warranty on this ended 10 days before the device broke so nothing i can do. works good. takes excellent pictures. love it. top demais recomendo great phone so far! excellent functionality!!!! excelent i am impressed with this phone, it meet my expection of it so far and the battery is very very good. i am in love with this phone so much. service is excellent. it came right away and i am extremely satisfied of my new product. this here is an excellent price as well. go to your carriers or even another party and the cost of this is like $600 which is bad. not only that you have to pay it monthly. this was excellent and if my friends or family members need it i will be sure to direct them here. thank you so much amazon for putting a big smile on my face. the phone arrived on time and is exactly as described. having trouble understanding the dual sim cards and trying to figure out how to activate it and what company to go with i wanted a replacement cellphone and didn\\'t want any kind of smartphone or mp3-playing phone or camera-phone, etc. so i ordered the cheapest phone available on amazon, which turned out to be this one. i\\'ve been happy with it; it does everything i need, and it was easy to figure out how it works without having to read the instruction manual (which was in spanish anyway).my only complaint is that because it\\'s not a flip-phone, the buttons are exposed and so sometimes they get pressed when the phone is in my pocket. but i\\'m sure i can get a phone cover or something, if i decide that this is too annoying. this is a great cell phone! i love it. tal cual como lo describió el vendedor totalmente satisfecho recomiendo a esta tienda muy buena atención excelente y llego rapido. good great dual sim phone for a family member in jamaica first of all, for the price, it can\\'t be beat! the features and apps aren\\'t quite as refined as the samsung phones but overall it works quite well. it seems to work well with my t-mobile account and shows lte most of the time here in the north metro atlanta area. this is actually my second one, the first lasted about 36 hours and just quit flat the first time i warmed it up by turning on the gps. amazon took amazing care of the problem and i had a replacement within two days even though i called them on a weekend.the limited color choices are annoying. come on, i\\'m a business guy, give me a black phone! the least goofy color available was white with a clear silicone protective case and after two weeks it\\'s starting to show, especially stuff getting in between the case and the phone. clear case / white phone: everything shows.none of the makers of accessories seem to know about blu and good luck finding cases and holsters. it\\'s the same size as the galaxy note 3 so things that fit the gn3 should fit the blu. since spare batteries are also hard (impossible?) to find, plan on keeping it plugged in just in case whenever you can. battery life isn\\'t bad but it won\\'t last a full 14-16 hour day of use like my old blackberry did.my only serious beef is that the gps is pitifully weak. laying on the dash of my car it only occasionally locks on and the rest of the time is searching for satellites. i\\'ve noticed that the bluetooth connection is also significantly weaker than my previous phones and those of others in my family. since i intended to use it in the cockpit as a backup moving map the gps thing is a serious drawback for me but i\\'ve decided that i\\'ll keep it as just a phone. this is the best phone so far, everything about it is great. the quality of the videos and pictures are amazing. the only reason i don\\'t rate five stars is because of the key board, its hard to space words because of it. other than that its an amazing product and recomend it for those who want a good phone but cant afford those newer model, expensive phones. este telefono, es excelente es super rapido con el wifi, era un regalo cual a mi hija le encanto, el color lila super bello, es un telefono que se puede recomentar para la chicas jovenes le sacan mucho provecho - the headphones stopped working after a few moths- the touch screen doesn\\'t always respond- the lock button stopped working almost immediately- had to get sim card tray replaced- battery only lasts 10 hours with minimal usewhen i was first getting this p great cell phone for college students! functional and economic! i bought two of these phones because i wanted to surprise my friends, who were going away on a trip and both of them needed new phones. i looked at many different smart phones on here, specifically with 4g lte, which in itself narrows the selection. this phone stood out to me. the price seemed ok, the specs sounded fine and the reviews were encouraging. so i bought two. i was excited about getting them, and giving them away but the joy of the surprise didn\\'t last very long. both phones have inaccurate sensors. if i tap a letter in the top row, it gives me language selection. i need four, sometimes five attempts to open an app because it doesn\\'t respond to lighter touch. it becomes extremely annoying when you type a message and it frequently inserts a suggestion, just because you typed the letter slightly upward. even for a budget phone like this one, i expected better adjustment. i also couldn\\'t, like in my own phone, (which was the same price but seems a much better quality) calibrate the sensor to have a more accurate typing experience. there was no way to fix this.as i gave the two phones away, the frustration was high as i felt i had made a bad choice. i am returning at least one of them and have already ordered a phone of which i know that it works.there is some good about these phones however. the wifi is relatively fast and the phone itself is fast in opening apps for example. the screen is very clear and almost looks like a retina screen, very high quality. the colors are vibrant. this phone comes with a screen protector and a slim silicone case. all of that is absolutely great and i like that the sellers do sell a product with thought behind it. but all the good doesn\\'t help if the one thing that makes a phone useable, being able to type or press on a symbol is not working well. great price. works like a charm. if you are looking for a high quality smartphone, and great service, soonersoft electronics will be the right choice ! yes it works great everything seems perfect except that the front camera is not too sharp for me. perfect condition. nice phone, works good and looks beautiful. the only thing i feel not so appreciating is that it is an unlocked at&t. love it! best phone for its price. no other phone in the same price range comes close to what you get from 920. works great for straight talk. i am enjoying my new phone. i still have a lot to learn about it. just bought a new cover for it. love this phone easy to use and lots of great apps additional review after owning this item for 14 months:after owning this phone for 14 months, i must say i love this phone more and more each day. today, i successfully connected my ipad to this phone through bluetooth to get on internet without wi-fi. there is no problem with emails and general browsing. i even watched a video, although interrupted a couple times. unlike my other phone, this phone making switching on/off bluetooth and adding/deleting pairing devices very simple and secure.fiy: i do have unlimited grandfather data plan with this phone.--------------------------------------------------------original reivew after owning this item for 8 months:i have own this phone for 8 months and have travelled to asia with it.i must say i was not very used to a phone with full keyboard. and the full keyboard is not very useful to me as i do not text messaging/email a lot. in fact, it gave me quite some headache at first as so many phone numbers were remembered as letters in us (such as 4-police). however, after all the time being, i like it more and more.it is not a smart phone. however, it serves the purposes to surf internet such as for checking train schedule, weather...etc. unlike my another window phone which will get on line without my permissions and caused me $$$ and endless trouble with phone bills, this nokia c3 phone has very clear and easy operate wlan controls and warning to allow me to always choose the right wlan provider.not like some other easy broken toy-like phones, this phone has a decent look and is nicely built. the battery life is desirably long which makes it a perfect travel companion.and recently, i notice nokia provides many free games for downloading that i spent quite a good time playing them. this adds another plus for a long travel.i am happy to give this light weight pocket size phone 5 stars. excellent device ... the battery life is fantastic. simplifying the software is definitely a big improvement. the screen is outstanding, adding fingerprint sensor and a heart. the back deck and its famous holes make it difficult to slip out of hand. and resistance to water and dust to ip67 certificate is something that should be almost mandatory in all móviles.la camera always produces spectacular photos as there is enough light and is best hdr video recording. mimo and 4g wifi connection are quick and the power and performance is more than enough games to entertain even complex graphics. in venezuela it works fine with operators. perfect delivery timing since i was about to travel outside the country and had no issues to get a line since the phone was unlocked.phone has all the features to be a great working/business tool, fast and easy and also great for entertainment: awesome camera, great sound for music. i love it and so did my brother, so i had to leave it for him as a present jajaja nice it looks like a 007 james bond movie pretty cool watch everybody likes my watch 5 stars a winn run from this seller and dont look back, i bought this i phone 32gb and when i got it headed to the att store to activate the phone. long and behold it would not activate, the sim card would not read. i was told to go to the apple store to see if they can figure it out which i did. it turns out that it was not a 32 gb iphone but a 16gb, the phone was a damaged phone and should have never been sold. this seller is a bad business person. runnnnnnnnn work great. i love this phone. i changed it from the galaxy s5. i only have problems with finding out where the videos are, but eventually i will figure it out. el producto es igual a la foto y estaba bien empaquetado y llego a venezuela en excelente estado gracias sigan asi quick & easy to put together and to get it up & running! i bought this for my wife for her birthday and she loves it hasn\\'t had any problems with the phone everything worked out as stated. phone is really worth for money but the only complaint is with lte with at&t, there is no band support with the n/w provider for this phone. update as of oct. 25, 2015: i did buy another used vx8300 here. it appears to have been deactivated in 2008 and does not have the 2011 mdr code update. i\\'ve found a cell tech in seattle who says he can get the software. if so, i\\'ll post the info. sure do love this old school phone.--------got my first vx8300 nine years ago. if i hadn\\'t lost it i\\'m sure it would still be working. i replaced it with a second vx8300, which worked fine til i dropped it for the umpteenth time a couple days ago. actually, the lower portion of the phone still works, but the video screen is toast. so, what to do about a replacement?i spent several hours today researching the new lg terra vn210, which was recommended to me. it\\'s not even in the same ballpark as the nine year old vx8300. the vn210 has no microsd slot, it has no video capability, its battery is only 950 mah compared to 1100 on the vx8300, one reviewer says the vn210 lacks evdo and is limited to 1x, it\\'s 20% bigger and has the same 1.3mp camera the nine year old vx8300 has! that\\'s an improvement?so, obviously i\\'m considering another vx8300. but there\\'s one big drawback that i haven\\'t seen mentioned in 28 pages of amazon reviews: the march 25, 2011 qualcomm mdr code upgrade that left thousands of verizon lg users out in the cold. in a nutshell, if you didn\\'t have the phone turned on when the mdr codes were sent down the line, your phone would \"error (3332)\" and you could no longer access getitnow or your backup assistant. the codes were only selectively distributed for a short time to various verizon stores and tier 2 techs in certain regions, then pulled by verizon corporate.verizon should have stepped up and dealt with the problem immediately, but they let it fester and spent months dodging the issue while orphaned users screamed at them. of course, i didn\\'t know about this til i\\'d already bought a replacement phone that wasn\\'t turned on when the upgrade was done. after months of back-and-forth frustration with verizon, i finally wound up shipping my phone 2000 miles to a verizon store in ohio, which was apparently the only store in the nation with a tech who both understood the problem and still had the mdr codes in her system! took her five minutes to do the fix. i was lucky to find her information posted in the verizon forum. otherwise...so, to all of you who\\'ve purchased a vx8300 and posted here in the last four years, can you access getitnow/media center? do you have access to backup assistant? how about vznavigator? do you have the updated qualcomm mdr codes? i\\'d like to know before i buy another vx8300, because i sure don\\'t want to go through all that again.otherwise, i pretty much love the vx8300. good product, thanks i\\'ve had the phone for about a month now and i\\'d say it\\'s really nothing to write home about. when the cpu usage is a little too high it starts to freeze up quite a bit. i can only use instagram and snapchat when most other applications are closed out and when you plug headphones in the volume is automatically throttled down to about %50 even when it says %100 and there\\'s no work around for this issue. i had to purchase a separate bluetooth headphone adapter to get decent volumes. other than that i guess for the price the phone will do in a pinch. great budget smart phone.the phone is plenty fast and screen resolution is fine for my uses. dual sim so i tried it on both att and t-mobile at the same time without any problems at all, switching between sims took about ten seconds. choice to store contacts on sim or on phone which is great if you need to keep them separated.hspa+ gave me speed test averages around 3-4mps download and 1-2 upload on both att and t-mobile, a little slower than 4g tests at the same time so if you were worried about the 3g spec, don\\'t.i find myself using the fm radio more and more often.why waste money for specs that make no difference to you. very good smartphone i payed the shipment to make it come on thursday / friday because i needed for the weekend and came on monday. however, it wasn\\'t a big deal but the phone is in some language that i don\\'t understand, with other alphabet and the manual too. is being really hard for me changing everything because idk even the letters!!!! i\\'m getting crazy.now i\\'m starting to worry abt if it will work in argentina or not. very good, working very well and i am happy with it. still using this phone a year later.. i\\'ve had zero issues with it except i butt dial people ... i bought it like \"new\" but it is not. it is refurbished and it suddenly stopped working my son wanted a watch. so, i researched all over amazon\\'s choices. this watch seemed to be excellent. it came in, i didn\\'t even open it, just gave it to my son, excited. he\\'s 14 and a tech junkie. he took one look at it and tossed it aside. he\\'s about 6 feet tall and a big guy. so, it shocked me to hear him say that the watch was not for him. he said the watch face, itself, is much too huge, too thick, too big for him to wear. he didn\\'t like it so much that he disregarded any tech capabilities on it, altogether and wasn\\'t interested in it any further. he left on the table beside him and didn\\'t give it a second look even though i advised him all it could do. nope, not even remotely interested because it was too big. i tried to attach a photo to show you why the thickness is an issue with him. i\\'ve still not used the item and the purchase was a long time ago. i\\'m keeping it though, hoping that one day, it will be useful to me. i\\'m thinking it may be useful for jogging purposes. but, i, really, can\\'t speak up on it. i haven\\'t used it. no one wants to wear such a thick faced watch. so, the technical features have not, yet, been experienced. so, if, i do take the time to find someone to use it, i will be sure to update you on that. the three stars is only that no one wants to wear it. i never write reviews, but i felt compelled to write one for this phone. i had the 1st edition moto g prior to this one. i do like this phone a lot, but wish it was smaller like the 1st edition i traded up from. i am still trying to get used to the camera adjustment for low light. it\\'s a great feature, but if you need to take a picture quickly like i did, most likely the lighting will not be correct.i was also not able to find any cases for this phone locally and bought a case through amazon that did not fit properly. though returns were easy for the case, i was without one until a new case was shipped.i have cricket wireless service, which works well with this unlocked phone. apparently this phone does have a slight glitch with photo messages from time to time according to cricket where you will have to reset your apn to default for the pictures to complete downloading. initially it worked, but after a few days usage somehow it would not allow the download. it was a simple fix, and i am hoping it will not happen often. great customer service. product arrived the exact day promised and it works so far. i haven\\'t really have time to use it, just test it with sim card, and as far as i can tell for now, it works this phone is just as the seller describe it, it works very well. only complaint is, it does not have the volume that our old phone did. but of course this is not the sellers fault. it was what i thought it would be good product at great price and no contract worries. good love it. work great with tracfone carrier. el teléfono lo enviaron defectuoso, ya lo he mandado a reparar varias veces y no me ha servido para nada junk great battery over heats 100% serious vender very recomended product received as advertised, and fast shipping. needs tweeking with the storage space, photo and video quality and it would be a 5star product. excellent the size for one it said 4.0 and it wasn\\'t also the volume goes in and out hello very good morning write them in order to tracking number requesting of phone urgent blu samba defective phone. it offers few solutions provider. bad buy. i would not buy no headphones, no charger but looks and works perfect. definitely worth it. so far i like it it has more than i expected when i travel with it and add the second sim i will be able to give a better review went to many stores and they could not tern the phone on they said it was european and cant be activated excelent i ordered a blue 5c with 8 gigs, i got a beat up white 5c with 4 gigs. i\\'m thinking about returning it, but i can\\'t go without a phone for long and i\\'m not sure how long it\\'ll take for them to get me the right one. i\\'m bummed out. i absolutely love this phone, i\\'ve been using it about 6 months now and it has never crashed or anything. i love the s pen feature that allows me to take a quick note regardless of what screen i am on however i do not understand the purpose of the multi window. i find that rather annoying but you can always turn that off. i had a nexus 5 prior to this phone and it was a major upgrade. the size is something to get used to as it is a bit bigger than most phones but it\\'s the best cell phone i\\'ve ever had. great i like my blu x150q. the only aspect to improve on my blu is the camera. i\\'m spoiled from my nokia520 camera, the images in artificial light with my blu do not look as nice as i\\'d like. i now have an issue with my blu phone not accepting a charge and the operating system continues restarting throughout the day. not good. excellent product.it is a must to have for travelers.really easy to setup and use. received the phone quickly but it does not work. will not hold a charge and won\\'t retrieve the contacts list. compete waste of money. avoid like the ebola virus. this phone is so full of bugs and so badly designed it\\'s hell on a battery. hard to know where to begin to tell you all the issues, suffice it to say caveat emptor! has problems taking photos or video outdoors screen resolution is terrible because the display is difficult to put very dark this krzr k1 is very neat and small, and carries alot of features. the time and callers phone number is seen on the outside of the phone when someone calls, so you can screen your calls. it\\'s trully a nice neat phone i\\'m one of those guys who hate to carry a whalet in my pocket, i only cared to carry my drivers license, insurance card and one credit card, now i can carry that along with my cellphone in a compact way. great idea the phone was great at first. i just had to get used to a touchscreen phone. then i thought the battery was dying on me. i bought a replacement battery and still had the same problem. it turned out that the screen would just go out. problem just got worse. lg is not my friend. using it and enjoying it. thanks! !!!!! i am extremely unhappy with this purchase...sound s***ty....i can\\'t hear thank you yesss, i love itexactly wht i expected the phone not has good reception, has connection issues, i tested with two operators in venezuela and malfunctions, do not go if your phone does not work here, i wonder a review of the seller, thank you.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------i\\'m writing to let you know that the lenovo s-850 , i just bought, it doesn\\'t work properly, because it is uncapable to get gsm signal.i could realize that it has shown in the box, just one (1) imei number, and the serial number shown in the os screen is 0000000.i bought a second gsm dual sim lenovo s-850, and works properly, in the same location and using the same gsm micro sim card to test.i could realize too, that this second telephone, shows 2 imei numbers in the box…i attached some pictures, to be checked by you…i wonder how are you going to solve this…really nice, but doesn\\'t work… i order one for my sister no problems, good solid phone, and then after seeing the phone my mom also decided she wanted one. i ordered it and at some point during the shipping before it entered the shipping packaging some idiot decided to open the phone\\'s box and play with it. the tape on the box itself was cut sticker was not on it the phone someone opened the screen protector it came with making it unusable and the decided to turn it on and adjust the brightness to where the screen cannot be seen making it impossible to see anything, and i cannot fix it. i hate ups and the moron who decided to screw with it. most likely asking for replacement, but complete waste of my time. good the phone worked at first perfectly fine but slowly started turning itself off randomly touch screen only works when it feels like it they phone was exactly as described great phone was a gift for my mother and played around with it all day i come from the lg g2 and this phone is just right. at first i thought could be to big for my mother since she is a small women but it helps out being big makes typing and viewing so much better. any one that likes a big phone and fast should get this one. great price i love my phone alot i can put it down awesome does not do what i wanted out of a smart watch. guess you get what you pay for. i would not buy again. excellent product! it just came like brand new! a very well made smart phone. easy to use. although an older version (iphones are now version 5), the manufacturer provides software updates. bought this for my daughters 14th bday - she loves it! it has no noticeable defects, scratches etc. it looks like it\\'s brand new, not used or pre-opened. was nervous it wouldn\\'t be as good as advertised - but it really was! thank you for providing an affordable alternative - great product/service! these are decent phones. i have owned several. when they work like they should, they do a great job, but i have had a lot of problems with these used ones. it\\'s a hit or miss thing. you might get a good one or you might get a bad one. but even if you do get a good one, there is still some limitations. first they come with a boat load of crap ware from the manufacturer and at&t that makes the phone sluggish right out of the box. of course, they won\\'t let you uninstall any of it, but you can disable most of it. so you have to spend an hour or two disabling the 30 plus apps that you do not need or want. then the phone works pretty good after that, and you have a little room to install some apps that you actually want, but not a whole bunch. if you install too many apps, the phone goes back to being sluggish again and gets to the point where it is barley usable. then you have to go back and disable and uninstall anything you absolutely do not need. this is true of just about any android phone because of androids horrid memory management, but it is much more of a problem on these older phones with lower resorces. came in terrible condition. very dissatisfied. will be returning nice phone not too fast not too slow please do not buy this product does not work i don\\'t love this phone for a couple of reasons which may not matter to others: 1) there is no user manual available - none came with it, none is available online, so while i am able to use it, i have no easy source to figure out a number of issues; 2) there is a known problem with the camera orientation, which is that some third-party apps, like my bank\\'s mobile app, are not compatible with the orientation of the camera. this is a pita when trying to take pictures of checks for deposit. the solution suggested on number forums is for us - the users - to contact the developers of the third party apps and scold them for not updating the apps to keep up with this and perhaps other phone cameras. not something i\\'m going to be doing. so despite having bought a case, a screen cover, and the adapters necessary to use all my chargers with this usb-c phone, i\\'m seriously thinking of returning it while i still can. excellente device el equipo cumple contodas las especificaciones que se establecen en el articulo, muy buen equipo, recomendado a los usuarios de los mismos wow! this is a great protective case! love it! very good phone works with all gsm networks in venezuela, this product comes as such, access to bbm, whatsapp and other basic applications described, no 3g love it ! love it ! & love it !😘😘😘😘😘❤❤❤💖💞💞💟💟👍👍👍💓💓💓💕it has finger scanner in the front ,really novel.big & really nice cellphone.the only drawback is that it\\'s a bit slippery material，but i still love it!texture feels good, noblefast shipping,good seller. after only one month, the proximity sensor stopped working, that means, that when i started talking, the screen was not able to get blocked and made me miss a lot of calls, and also, it was the cause that the phone batery could not last more than a couple of hours. after, around five (05) months using the phone in those conditions, the htc one x suddenly stopped working, what happened is that, without any reason, it lost the imei code, after that, there was no way to make it work again. i could only use it with a wifi conection, as if it were a kind of tablet. a couple months later, the screen just stopped working at all... all this, in fewer words, was money sent to the waste can. i feel angry and deceived. i will never again buy an htc product. love my new iphone case! i can carry my drivers license and credit card in the case without having to lug my purse in and out of the store. what\\'s nice is that it does not appear to have a compartment and looks like a normal \"high quality\" case. horrible did not work at all. reviews of this phone everywhere on the internet says it all. #1 phone of 2015. there could be a little, just a little more color variety :) besides that nothing else to say. the microphone is problematic and my voice is not audible to the person i called. moreover i expected the d820 model as i am staying in texas but i received the d821 model [rest of north america]. i ordered the s5 a couple weeks ago after my galaxy iii decided to kick the bucket, and i\\'m finding it to be an incredible improvement over the strengths the iii originally had. rather than go into detail over the phone\\'s features and beat a dead horse (cnet has a very comprehensive review you can read), i\\'ll discuss the \"buying experience.\"i purchased this phone from an amazon fulfilled vendor called \"the wireless circle\" (received it within 2 days via prime!), it came delivered in a standard amazon cardboard box and the phone itself in typical samsung packaging, brand new, with a quick-start booklet, headphones, usb 3.0 cable, and a charging plug. the battery was already fully charged.i am an at&t customer, but the website and the store were going to charge me $519 plus shipping, and no phones were available within a three-store radius where i live (hah!). i did some online research and realized buying an unlocked phone was the way to go. i could write an essay on the differences between an unlocked and contract-free phone (just google it) but if it helps - since i am an at&t customer, buying an unlocked at&t phone meant all i needed to do was take it to the store for activation. even then, all i needed to do when i got there was replace my sim card.ergo: i saved money by purchasing an unlocked phone. no more 2-year contracts for me! this is how i\\'m buying my phones from now, on. good, solid phone for the price. i bought two. nice design by apple. worth the price. ok, so this was my very first iphone, and i love it. it worked perfectly, and got to me in pristine condition. there was some confusion on how to unlock it, but the sellers gave amazing service and had a great attitude helping me out with it. i sent a lot of emails asking for help. all issues were resolved, and it works perfectly, even now. 3/11/14. good watch, but battery life dies quickly and functionality could of had more features i bought this phone as a spare for a \"just in case\" situation. the performance is a little slower than what i\\'m accustomed to but it gets the job done. the price is excellent in addition to being unlocked, this is one of the best deals around. i still have the phone and no issues at all. would definitely buy from this seller again. i loved my old htc 8x. inexpensive but powerful enough to do everything i needed to do (gps, run multiple apps in the background, etc.). i bought this one mostly because it was also unlocked and in black. turns out, though, verizon does not allow you to change the mms proxy servers, meaning, despite being unlocked for gsm bands, my at&t plan is unable to make use of picture texts. i have read elsewhere that data is also unavailable for other carries, though i can\\'t confirm this.basically a huge waste. great phone, but get it from another carrier. i bought it on vodaphone last time (still in black) and had no problems whatsoever. i bought it for my mom who lives in europe. so far she is very happy with this phone. i was little bit concerned with the fact that you need to unlock the phone with american sim before using it with any other card. but the process went smoothly. after making a call with an american sim card i inserted european sim and it worked perfectly.i saw that some people had problems with seals. i didn\\'t have any issues, phone came in a brand new box with well attached seals. also, i had no problems with phone being formatted to any specific language. amazing phone, amazing features. good phone to own. very next to impossible for an expert at texting to get right. i hate this phone the lg3 is 5 star the lg2 is a 2 if not a 1 or zero. explain: the space bar is not on the bottom center. when you type, for example \"i am going to the store\" it will come out like \"iiiii\" take a minute to erase all the extra i\\'s \"ammmmm\" take a minute to erase the extra m\\'s it\\'s just a pain so go with an envy3 i love my new phone! i was a little concerned about some of the reviews but i figured for the price i would take the risk. my phone looked brand new when it arrive. came with a generic usb cable and charger. no headphones. front camera does seem like it has less quality compared to my old 5s but the front one is the same. everything works as expected. súper excelente 100% cool!!!! being an iphone lover, i was bit apprehensive earlier to switch to samsung for it\\'s hot selling product. after one week of using it, i have completely fallen for this one. it actually justifies of being the \\'latest\\' mobile gadget available in the market and it gives you every bit of it. few points which make this one a must buy:superb gaming experience : i just couldn\\'t stop myself from downloading a couple of games and the playing experience has been fantastic.unbeatable camera : just give a cluck shot and you will fall for this one.doesn\\'t hang up: yes you heard it right,get ready for a flawless experience.marvellous looks: this device feels so sleek in hand, for those who want performance and looks, this one is certainly the best steal. great phone. great price. great condition.comes with a cheap looking charger, and not the original packaging. a+++++++++goodshiping and as he sade like new. the most important that 4g is working fine in my area. that what i need.thanks its a good phone.!! i used this phone just sometimes since it wasnt for me, but in the time used it works awesome its really fast and the graphics are really good. it has all that you can expect, the hardware is better than others similar phones. it did what it was supposed to do overall a great phone its not the most new note but it gets the job done the software update made it like a note 2 so overall i am happy with my debice besides needing a extra sim card and a blue tooth head phone this watch works great. the price is great to a lot less then the $ 200.00 that the other guys are asking. great phone. great camera. the camera is awful. the images are not clear at all. the battery doesn\\'t last at all. barely a day and a half. really bad buy. loved it phone works as advertised!! no complaints!!! i almost love it ... go blu fast and accurate service phone slowly started not responding, not working - over a 3 day period. got screen msg \"unfortunately, launcher 3 has stopped.\" also got a flash msg so fast could not read it all : \"...com . android systems... .\" then phone completely dead. only six months old. two repair shops could not fix it. now in process to send it back to blu... love it , is in very good condition and very good working. very fast shipping. delivery was spot on --phone performed just like the old one buen celular myuy buen precio y preciso en el tiempo que lo solicitñé gracias por ponerlo en venta lo recomiendo this phone works just fine and as described by the seller. there was not a scratch on it when i received it. i am very satisfied with this phone and would buy from this seller again. i love this phone i just got it today and it is so smooth and elegant... i used to use motorola, but this is a huge improvement... nokia is amazingupdate: it was working perfectly then died and never turned back on again. iphone is shipping now :/ excellent i was very happy with this purchase.the cost of the otterbox defender case was much less then purchasing at a store.it is very durable and i feel my phone is well protected. the instructions were very clear that it came with. great phone, work very well i find value for money for this phone. i was so hesitant to migrate to samsung phone. now am embroided in the brand. excellent i had this phone before but unfortunately it did not make it through the wash. it is a basic phone with large numbers that are easy to use. nothing fancy, but my favorite! excellent,htc is simply the best. even when the phone is used and have a failure in the back camera the phone did not work very well, the build is way cheaper then it looks, i would not get this phone. even years after its release this phone is still fast enough for just about anything you could throw at it. the 3gb of ram is much needed for powerusers who love multitasking. i bought this as a replacement for my original razr (that\\'s the one with the battery that lasts about 1 1/2 hours). this one has great battery life and i believe it operates better than my old one. everything is good wouldn\\'t allow me to accept multimedia messages and people on the other end couldn\\'t hear me. terrible.. camera sticks.. apps stick... please don\\'t waste your money the product is good and meet my expectations. since i bought it i have not noticed any problem with it. i recommend it positively for use this is a nice looking phone, looks way better then my iphone 6 plus, work great too as expected from a samsung product 👍 my speaker at the bottom is broken and there are some chips and dings that i wasn\\'t notified on but over all i love my new phone. everything arrived fast and we\\'ll packaged. watch does what i expect it to and is a fun little gadget. device was not unlocked per at&t. it was time waste to order and then return. i am so pleased with this phone. i had been looking for one for weeks, but they were so expensive. especially with the 32g that i wanted. it came in good time, in good condition. and i love it! everything was as it should be. this is perfect phone for daily uses. comfortable and very simple. the battery lasts for a long time. excellent this is a versatile basic phone. although, it is not advanced in the \"iphone\" tradition, it has it\\'s own usefulness. i\\'m still investigating it...... wrong phone had to send it back a beautiful stable phone. this phone performs flawlessly with its sharp up-today\\'s windows os. i recommend it to anyone. it\\'s fun to see the tiles constantly jump. a true black screen that lets its tiles\\'s color stand-out. this product is very good, and i really enjoy using it......i will spread the good news to some of my friends.... got this for my son...so far he loves it!!!...it seems to do all it claims...he\\'s still figuring it out...only had it about five days. mixed bag of pluses and minusespros:+ screen/image quality - i set mine at about 25% brightness for the most part and it\\'s still very clear and vibrant+ audio - the dolby hi-fi is great! i just moved from the htc one m7 with beats audio and the zte is just as good. crisp music. less bass than the one.+ camera - lots of customization. focusing could be faster though. dedicated camera shutter button (btw does not activate the camera though)+ bloatware - not that many. the android os is pretty clean.+ 4gb ram - no lagging yet+ high-class style - i have the blue one and the buttons have gold accents. nice touch!cons:- processor - playing hungry shark for 20 minutes caused the back of the phone to be very hot- jbl earphones - very cheaply made. not worth the $50 \"suggested retail price\" per zte\\'s website. my $10 skullcandy produced better sounds too- button placement - i don\\'t like the power button where it is. hard to press. i\\'m always pressing the volume button along with the power button- storage capacity - 32gb but really about 24gb free to use for personal stuff- body - the backing is not completely flush. seems to be in three pieces and on mine the top left piece is not perfectly flush to the middle piece. kind of shows the lack of 100% qc.final thoughts:specs on paper are amazing, truly a flagship competitor. however, value doesn\\'t hit a perfect score. especially when you can find the brand name flagships at around this price point now. lg g4 for about $420-470 on ebay. samsung s6 for about $500. long term, i hope this phone will satisfy my needs and that the warranty will hold up.**** updated 9/9/15 *****this phone is giving me too many issues:- not receiving any incoming calls (big issue)- screen rotation gets stuck sometimesi really wanted to like this phone but just too inconsistent. so it\\'s heading back to amazon. works as advertised and it is a great product for the disabled. greatcall has the best customer service i have ever experienced. all features work great, the only thing that below my expectation is i can only get 2g data rate out of it.i believed it is 3g+ capable, but i never got 3g data, i have to switch back to my old phone with windows phone 6.5to get higher data rate. after reading a ton of reviews for budget smart watches i settled on this brand. was easy to charge. programming is difficult and. took a few hours and youtube videos to master...calling, texting and updates work....great starter piece...the fit was great for my bf but he has very large wrists. face is large and he has no problems using his big hands during operation phone was great. seller shipped it quickly!the phone just bricked itself! manufacturering issue.[...]lg will replace it. i\\'m having them replace, buit it will be an att bloatware version :( and will take a week to replace great price, great phone, looks good and works perfectly,thanks. nice very mediocre, the bluetooth range is garbage, a wireless speaker i have needs a 6 in range with this phone, where other phones are about 10 ft with no loss in quality. if you are using in the usa like i am, i learned it was either at&t or t-mobiles network only, i use straight talk and while compatible it is horrible in my area, so please check your service first for this technology before swapping to this phone. this is a fantastic phone, easy to handle size wise and the keyboard is large enough for me to work with as a senior. the features are very easy to use and the clarity is great. i have not yet added any more services but will soon. a great phone! works great it protect the phone and all the good stuff. **see update below**i\\'ve been using this phone for over 3 weeks now and i so glad i went with the z5c.hardwareit heats up a bit when doing heavy gaming or long video recordings, but not all too concerning...especially considering i don\\'t notice any heat during typical daily operation. i would say the battery is adequate but it wouldn\\'t be considered one of the strengths of this phone. i don\\'t imagine battery life gets any better with other phones unless you go bigger...which, why the hell would you be looking at this phone if you were willing to do that? go with the xperia z5. that said, i haven\\'t experimented too much with \"stamina mode\" but if you use alternate messaging services / apps (like google voice) or music streaming apps, you\\'ll have to add those apps as exceptions to be able to use data when the screen is off...which will diminish the benefit of \"stamina mode\" and preclude you from using \"ultra stamina mode\" all together. this is my first quick charge 2.0 device and i\\'m very impressed with how much charge you can get out of having it plugged in a just a while (ie 10 minutes). wireless charging would\\'ve been nice to have but i\\'ll gladly sacrifice that feature to get dual front facing speakers, expandable memory, and water resistance.speaking of expandable memory. my buddy was playing with a camera-equipped drone his girlfriend got him for christmas and was bummed he couldn\\'t get the videos off the micro sd card (he didn\\'t have an adapter). everyone at the party (iphone users) was blown away at how i was able to get and share the video by putting the micro sd card in my phone and using google drive to share it. i don\\'t know why we are letting phone manufacturers sucker us by buying phones without expandable memory.at 720p screen resolution / quality looks great to me. if reading small text is difficult or annoying or you plan on watching hd full-length movies on your phone, get a bigger phone. i have excellent eyesight and find this display great for watching youtube videos or reading articles.i don\\'t take a lot of photos / videos but i\\'m pleased with the camera so far. you can find great camera comparisons online. from what i found this camera is great but samsungs perform better in low-light and close up focusing...but the z5c is a huge step up from my htc one m7 when it comes to low light pictures.softwarei was a big fan of htc\\'s sense ui and didn\\'t know how i\\'d like sony\\'s ui as this is my first smartphone from them. after downloading an htc-like free clock / weather widget, i like the ui a lot. screenshots and screen capture are particularly easy and fun. still waiting for android 6.0 marshmallow update that was promised (see summary below).summaryas far as i know the perfect phone doesn\\'t exist but based on the other flagship phones available right now and my preference for water-resistance, expandable memory, and front facing speakers...i was prepared to give this phone a perfect 5 stars. i\\'m giving it 4 however because it would appear that sony is following the lead of others by promising \"soon\" updates to the latest android version (6.0 marshmallow) to help sell their new flagship phone but then making those of us who believed them and bought the phone wait around while the update is delayed. if the update comes prior to the new year i\\'ll adjust my review to 5 stars. almost 3 months for an update seems like enough time to tailor marshmallow to their ui...if it was a priority.**update**this is the worst phone i\\'ve ever had. on paper it\\'s great but i\\'ve never been so frustrated with lagging issue. i\\'ll get a phone call while its in my hand and i\\'ll mis the call because pushing \"answer\" is non-responsive. killing apps helps a bit but i find myself restarting the phone a lot. i was hoping the marshmellow update would help but its now march 8th & still no update. first & last time i buy a sony phone. since the galaxy s7 is water resistant with expandable memory, i think i\\'ll get it if a softwarw update comes soon & fixes my problems. this phone is a smooth operator, plays games, runs my business software. i am so happy. and the price wasn\\'t terribly steep. excellent product timely delivery highly recommended excelent this phone was for my husband, the only thing i notices was his old phone has a flash, whereas this one didn\\'t. very low capacity love this phone. highly underrated. superfast lots of storage. audio is great. battery life not bad. it\\'s not that good excellent nothing to say other than : go for it.the screen is good. the volume is extremely loud. the audio quality is very good. i don\\'t really play with the phone except using tetris. for email, facebook and so on is amazing. the gb space is just perfect. it\\'s working alright. shipping was delayed from china a few days. bit phone works great. no problems at all works with straight talk by the waymy daughter loves it screen is big and display is good but only one thing she has said sometimes you have trouble hearing when using itbut overall good buy good qualityand works great!!!! incredible phone! since android 6.0 update battery does not last a full day, roughly 13-14 hours with little use, and worst of it all, the \"waterproof\" is virtually a lie, dropped in the sink, the second it touched the water, the phone immediately stopped working, now i\\'m out 500 dollars. it took several weeks to get it. they mailed it from china. also, the clip is fixed, meaning that it doesn\\'t rotate to allow reorienting the phone on your belt. it is simple and basically functional. it was cheap, but the month-long wait was not foreseen. unable to connect my t-mobil phone service .it\\'s not 4g, it was 3g so far so good when talking on the phone sometime you cant hear what the person is saying, all i hear is noises. other than that it very fast. excellent product thanks don\\'t buy this cellphone from logitech llc, i tried to turn it on and didn\\'t work. i charged it for a couple of hours and i cound\\'t make it work. also the screen was defective like if it was hit.this cellphone is neither original . i\\'m very happy with my purchase was different,flashy and the talk of all my friends,not expensive like the over rated \"galaxy\" cellphone watches! a real good choose. sent it back because it would not work with at & t the galaxy s6 phone is very good but there\\'s one thing that really disappoints me. sometimes the battery does not fully charge and i really don\\'t know why. also, i think that the price is higher than it should be. the phone works well both in the us and internationally. one of my sim cards is for phone company in brazil and there is not problems. the only problem is that i cracked the lens so i guess i will have to buy another phone, but this time i will get a protective cover. the cost to repair the existing phone is more than i paid for the phone. i like the phone otherwise. i love iphones! this phone is a great piece of technology. i recommend getting it. love it thank you for the wonderful phone. i was giving this phone as a gift and i really appreciate the great service it is a great phone as we have 2 already! however the quality & condition in the description of this phone were very misleading to say the least! it was in very poor condition and 3 different colors lol! and the opportunity system has been tampered with severely! of importance, i have not yet contacted company to see what they would be willing to do or not. just haven\\'t had time will hopefully update once i do. i throught the item was made bettrer then it look\\'s, the screen could be a little bigger then it is now. but i like the functions and the style the item. excellent what the text doesn\\'t mention is that the phone i received was the world version, not the north american version. this meant that i would couldn\\'t take advantage of lte speed and was stuck with 4g. connects to iphone in the most limited sense of the term. does allow texting via device but you would really need a stylus to hit the tiny digital keys it provides. most functions do not work as installed on device. seems to be aimed at android devices. instructions in poorly translated english. i got what i paid for, to put it simply. we bought this phone and it does work with the ptel $20/mo plan that has 3g/4g just fine. the phone is awesome, you just have to grab a ptel sim from ebay for 99cents to pop in it, we are very happy to have an awesome up-to-date phone on a frugal priced plan. it is not charging not working awesome good midrange smart phone with some features on the top of the line didnt know it was a mini.. still 4 stars this phone is crap, i haven\\'t even used it because all it does is shut itself off and freezes.. i wouldn\\'t recommend it to anyone. great phone, a bit smaller screen but very legible. i have gsm version on straight talk with att, very pleased. pro: supports wireless (qi) charging. con: non-removable back and battery. had one of thise for a year before it broke got another one great construction super durable and its deff water resistat muy bueno love it! fast ,thin, light ,good looking and good size memory!!! 2 hours+ to set up. horrible. 100% recomendado very good great price, great product! brand new iphone for a really good price! bought this phone to replace 4s, but have had nothing but trouble. the camera only works toward the texter, not out the back the right way. my i tunes and computer do not recognize it at all. how do i get a refund? quisiera hacer pública la más vil estafa de la cual he sido víctima por parte de esta gente (wireless experts, inc), no es gente seria ni responsable...les comento que recibí hace 3 días en venezuela un equipo de estos, lo cual podría traducirse en que bote casi 400$, ya que una vez recibido el artículo ofertado me percate que el mismo estaba bloqueado (locked) y lo más grave aún, es que presenta un problema en su lectora de tarjeta sim, por lo cual arroja al encenderse un msj de error de inicialización. al contactar al vendedor sólo me respondió si aceptaba un reembolso de 50$ por los daños y molestias ocasionadas. que lamentable que aún existan personas como estas en amazon. no compren nada de lo ofrecido por esta gente y corran la voz, no caigan en trampas ni engaños (equipos repotenciados y de mala calidad). lo certifico y tengo el correo electrónico recibido guardado (a través del cual me ofrecen como reembolso 50$ por los daños y perjuicios ocasionados).want to make the most public vii which he scam victim by these people (wireless experts, inc.) is not responsible or serious people ... i must remark that i received 3 days ago in venezuela a team of these, which could translate into $ 400 boat almost as once received the item offered the same i realized that i was locked (locked) and still the most serious problem in presenting your sim card reader, so to catch fire throws a initialization error msg. to contact the seller only if answered me accepted a $ 50 refund for damages and inconvenience caused. sorry that people still there how are you in amazon. do not buy anything offered by these people and run the voice, no scams or fall in traps (repotenciados equipment and poor). certify the e-mail and i have been saved (through the back as is offered me $ 50 for the damages arise). it\\'s great!! purchased 3 for business phones, 1 needed return and was replaced promptly, had an issue with handset mic no longer working after using the included earbuds. replacement did not have the issue until about 2 months after owning, 1 has battery life issues to the point of being useless without a charger every few hours, and one seems to work ok but doesn\\'t see a lot of use. product is great, but i order it black and it came blue.... =/ still good though i purchased it for $100 less than att store on amazon and it is meeting up to my expectations. i like that it is water resistant. i have been a bb user for at least 5 years and have often owned the latest models mostly for business use. i purchased this one as a personal bb. unfortunately, automatically i could tell it was not of the same quality as the others. it was much lighter and just felt flimsier. it also took a while to figure out how to download bb messenger which came pre-loaded in my past bbs. perhaps that is standard, but it just seemed a bit odd to me that bb did not include bb messenger pre-loaded in its own devices... on the description it said this phone worked with straight talk service. it does not and my service said the phone is locked too. this watch does the bare bone basic of a smart watch. so if you need something flat out simple, it will do, but i bet you can find a cheaper one. holding the watch now, i will admit it is ugly to look at, and the displays quality is low standard. what i honestly got this watch for was to change the face for a cosplay, but the device flat out lacks the ability to change it. not only that, it uses its own pos of an app to connect it, unlike most watches that use android wear. after writing this review, i\\'m heading out to the ups store to return it... after 6 weeks one day it need it to be charged, i put it to charge and went to check on it and it was extra hot. it never charge again and still getting hot. waste of my money the seller said i only had 30 days garranty so i could not returned. i got this for my daughter that lives out of state she took it to a store that said it was not unlocked she took it to another store and they told her that kind of phone would work for calls overseas and would be touch and go for other calls.i\\'m not sure what all was said but she is not using . she said she would try another store but not right away i continue to have issues with connectivity with this phone. a list of the most common issues are:*bar level is has never exceeded three bars, usually stands at two bars* frequently cannot make calls --- shows \"emergency calls only\" prompt*frequently drops calls*unable to connect with application for home security systemsince the vendor \"the good guys\" customer service online website does not allow a user outside of australia to leave inquiries for customer support. i have contacted my cellular provider numerous times with the issues and they are unable to resolve or identify the issue. this is the second samsung cell phone that i have purchased (previous one was an s4). i purchased the phone because of the reasonableness of the cost. i experienced service issues with both phones. when i select my cell phone it will definitely not be a samsung or purchased via the internet. works for 2 weeks and then breaks. weird ads pop up and i hate it awesome pretty good worked well but the charge burnt up the charging port after a few months. love it cool product, great size, everything is great and work with movistar 3g and movilnet 3g in venezuela best case for children who have the iphone 5s. no worries if they drop it. phone does not break and gives me peace of mind. perfect! i got everything fast. the box was sealed, phone\\'s excellent! love it!!! the condition was as shown! very please. love this phone a lottttt great little phone just what i needed a non-smart phone with wifi. it is used on at&t with no data plan and photo turned off on the account can\\'t send photos because you would need the att internet services turned on to do this, so no web service thru att, i just use hot spots or home networks for the web and email. the only service used thru att is phone and text. this phone does not have gps tracking = non-smart....1.also has a built in fm receiver.2.yes it has bluetooth.3.it loads web pages not like a iphone it\\'s on the slower side but good enough for me.4.good battery life.hope this helps i am android all the way and will never own one of these, but my daughter really wanted this and she loves it. phone was in great condition. works wonderfully. great to have as a backup phone. amazing camera i have not received the product blackberry curve 3g 9300 unlocked gsm smartphone with 2 mp camera wi-fi, gps, bluetooth - unlocked phone - international version - graphite grey excelllent the worst thing i ever purchased i need my money back, my cellphone works but all the applications i download like what\\'s app or viber dont\\'t work,when i turn the phone on it gives a java message.i am traveling nod not staying connected to my folks back home is devistating. got to me quickly. great phone. the iphone does not work. my service provider could not activate it because it still had an account associated to the serial number of the phone. i purchased as refurbished. while the phone may work (i really don\\'t know because it can\\'t be activated. the seller has been contacted and has not contacted me to resolve the problem. why? i don\\'t know other than they are not reputable, unprofessional, and could care less about their customers. either way i would highly recommend amazon remove them as a seller on their website. i am very disturbed and dissatisfied that i could be ignored as a customer and shown no respect about this issue. i will certainly pass this experience on to others, many others. i hope amazon can lean on them to do what is right. a $330 rip-off is completely unacceptable for any so called, wanna be, legitimate company. i hope u can syndicate my feedback and get it to the right people! i order this for my cousin so far he likes it. i will do a update review if needed. perfect phone... got it for my 12 year old daughter. she loves it exactly what i wanted i am so unhappy with my htc sensation. it takes forever to open the message board, forever to start the camera. keeps on jamming, freezing, all after less than a week of owning it.i just don\\'t recommend this phone to anyone. phones are brand new factory? buy one a few days ago. i get the phone i do not agree with serial box. explain this. my phone provider said it might have trouble or stolen the camera is not all that good.. love having this protection on my galaxy note 10.1. and the price could not have been better. i received this so fast. love otter box ! phone is great but having a hard time finding a case for the phone. love this phone so much!!! love the phone i think we are missing out on the best quality ever the phone is superb and we need to sell more having some issues with the phone. voice quality is getting poor after every 4 mins. replaced broken phone. all is well the phone works great its just that the bluetooth would kick me off a lot from my bluetooth headphones and my headphones have nfc and the phone would not work when i tried to pair the two using nfc i am very pleased with the product that i received, everything was in the box as promised and the device works great! its ok. for sure for kids or someone who wants to have a smartphone for the first time and has a very low budget excelente mint condition and my wife absolutely loves it. best phone ever! great service and product! excelent great i am htc fan. i am totally satisfied with the my phone. i don\\'t get impressed by i phone or samsung. htc is a great quality phone. very pleased. excellent seller well it is unlocked but does not connect to the internet. hope it will someday. i did my best in connecting it to the internet ... compré hace unpar de semanas este teléfono y me lo traje para ecuador. está funcionando perfectamente. no tuve que hacer ningún tipo de actualizaciones ni nada. simplemente cambié mi gsm prendí el teléfono y a hablar. buen producto. the phone itself and the speed with which i received the phone were great. the only issue i had was that, since it is a verizon phone, it could not send or receive picture messages under my plan (t-mobile). the ability to edit the apn for picture messages was locked, and therefore i decided to return it. i have since learned of an app for windows phone called \"network setup\" that directly fixes this problem on all windows phones and have used it on my new windows phone. excelent like the phone. having a few minor problems and don\\'t know if it\\'s the phone or the operator. yes i would recommend this product and the seller. good this is the best phone i have owned. very fast processing. beautiful screen. great tools for setting up the features and modes.i am not sure there is a better phone for this price. i basically plugged in my sim card, a 64gb memory chip and charged the battery. it has worked flawlessly since then.i suggest that you let the phone completely discharge a couple of times. this will calibrate the battery life feature. my phone came with the screen was nasty with hand prints on it & the charger was broke. not to mention 2 of my letters won\\'t work when i\\'m typing & the screen sometimes move up & down by iyself broke in the first week. excellent product iphone 6 plus is great it\\'s five star 😄 color is not the same as picture works really well in my area and it is a nice size compared to the bigger monster sized ones out now. super nice phone. especially great camera and display for the price. the ps4 remote play is cool too. i bought a blackberry bold 9790 from good guys electronics the phone came in the original box and the phone with the usual wrapping of a new phone it was a refurbished phone advertised as new. love this phone!!! it is the perfect size, cameras awesome, battery last all day. what more could a girl want?? best value i\\'ve found in a phone of this type. works without fail. i love love love this phone. verizon no longer carries it and when my old twist broke i went to nokia who directed me to amazon\\'s secure/preferred site. i did not want a smartphone, but i still wanted a \"cute\" phone that had great texting capabilities. i would def reccomend it! basic phone that does works as advertised. good reception.all over europe, even in rural areas. almost never our of range. upgraded from from a 4s that met an unscheduled demise. was pretty burned about it until my 5s showed up in the mail. if you keep your phone locked, the fingerprint id alone is worth the upgrade. one touch and you\\'re in! punching in a code every time you want to access your phone seems so archaic. all the other features are just icing on top. i\\'m one of those who is just not into this current fad of gargantuan cell phones just to have a big screen. i loved the size of the 4, and after having the 5 for awhile i think it\\'s the perfect size. still easy to \"one-hand\" the phone and still easily slips into your front jeans pocket. i\\'m keeping the 5s for as long as i can keep it dry! thicker than expected. specs are not good as its price. accessories boxes are bigger than its needed during shipping it moves a lot. it came with the camera flash not working. actually i\\'min agreement with many other customers who score it with 5*. everything about this phone i like. even screen, which has less attractive resolution in reality looks perfect. good connection with wifi and 4g. very decent battery life. speedy. worth it cost 100%. i\\'m a cricket customer by the way. the phone was defective and would not read a sims card for any service that was tried. if i could get a phone that was not broken, i think that i would have been overly satisfied! great phone and very good service i give you 5 stars / i love this phone / thanks alot and very fast service and customer service was great thank you .alexis a brand new samsung phone focus as advertised. took the sim card out of an old htc, put it in the unlocked focus and we\\'re back in business for a little over $100. has more options and programs than i know what to do with even playing on the internet. thanks wireless experts!!! don huber this phone looks like new and works perfectly. just inserted the sim card from my old phone, went through the easy setup prompts and done! i like the phone because it\\'s well made and reasonably priced. however i do not know how reliable it will be in the long run. great iphone 5s. takes very decent pictures for such a tiny camera and lens. i like the hdr which helps even out the lighting. but, it still not as good as a dedicated digital camera, but still very convenient, and good enough to take good snap shots for posting online, which is a very convenient and smooth procedure. screen looks good and does not scratch easily. so, i am very happy with it! just to inform you that i received open box and 1 item is missing (blu energy x2 cell phone).your assistance to this matter is greatly appreciated. thank you once again and have a great day.. description said it works for 4g but it didn\\'t work. it was 3g. also first time i didn\\'t received the phone !! box only came with accessories, i had to back twice and finally got refunded. nice phone just as expected as far as non smart phones go this one was pretty neat, good ringtones and what not. i believe you can add a memory card and download and play music. my mom doesn\\'t know how to do that so its perfect for her. be careful when putting the back on, she bent one of the little plastic prongs and now it doesn\\'t close all the way. excellent, as expected the phone has a poor battery life, my headphones do not work with it. i need headphones that are specifically for this phone and the charger isn\\'t the universal. i am not happy with this product. besides those things the pictures are really awesome, but that\\'s about it. very user friendly, and quality durable case and high defination screen. very comparable to an i-phone without the cost. been using the phone for every day use and have not had any problems. three months. use the phone in high heat and humidity, and have not experienced any problems. the apps are good, speed, and the phone can stay charged for up to 4 days without charging with normal use. i am so rough on phones i do keep mine in a camera case due to lots of heavy bumpy items in my backpack. sorry to hear about the poor customer service from blu. i love this phone and many of my associates are amazed at the price and quality. in 1 month it doesn\\'t work anymore it works perfect in argentina! my sd card does not work in the phone due to issue with the phone. quick delivery and exactly as advertised. use it mainly in europe and works perfectly. i had trouble being heard in a croweded room of people chatting. even turned up to max, we had to disconnect and put the radios up to our heads some of the time. i love the phone. everything was so quickly.thanks i bought one htc one x with this store, that one had problems with the simcard but this people changed the first one for another one x and in only two days they sent me another one, this has worked perfectly and it seems like new.this store is pretty serious, i recommended it to other friends who have bought more one x s, and everybody is very happy with the product. the smartphone really seems new. great phone. have it with me constantly. great reception/ no regrets. clearpictures. many free apps. easy to text. never regret purshase. i love my blu phone i didn\\'t find the camera resolution as great as they picture it. great purchase! it was as good as new... screen was immaculate and had no surface scratched. i\\'m very satisfied with my purchase. i like it i love it so much. i was a little scared when i saw the manual and the cd in some weird lanuage .. but i managed to switch it back to english. not a high-end phone for the features it speaks of. really goes slow with everything. whether it is changing song, changing profile, opening camera, browsing contacts .. but you get used to it.love the design, voice clarity, battery life. beautiful case!!! very happy with this product!!! blackberry 8520 unlocked phone with 2 mp camera, bluetooth, wi-fi--international version with no warranty (black)everything came well excellent all good excellent product. was received at the indicated time and without any difficulty, as based on the place of purchase. recommended one product well i bought this phone in may 2013 now jan,2014 .screen stop working properly. this is my second droid 2 the first one screen just went black, you could still hear ring tone just couldn\\'t see how to answer. so i try another one and now different but still screen problem on the newest one.doesn\\'t recognize touch. i hate having to get another phone so soon. good ok watch great screen and decent old person phone :) easy to use i purchased my phone july 2015 it\\'s a ok phone my review is not about the phone but there customer service. be aware that when you purchase this phone that there customer service is horrible. beginning of october i had issues with my sd and sims slot not reading. i contacted alcatel concerning the problem and was told i would have to send my phone in to be repaired for 15 days. when i asked why so long and i quote their customer service person said \" i sent you the email so do what you want\". i complained on twitter the alcatel company contacted me about the problem saying they needed more information it\\'s been a week still have not spoken to anyone or gotten help with this problem. horrible customer service horrible phone. i guess you pay for what you get! 😫👎🏽😡😡😡😡😡. final verdict all alcatel could for me was offer me a free shipping label. if you purchase this product and it breaks you have to send it in to there repair center. they did not offer to replace the phone or even send a refurbish phone. phone in the garbage like there company is garbage. i would not buy this phone. i love my new blackberry!! i have always loved blackberry\\'s and i was needing a new phone but i wanted something different from the iphone. i just popped my sim card in there and it went to work! the only thing is all the directions were in spanish haha but the cd it came with had the catalog in english and everything so it was fine! so far so good for me, i love my phone. i was so excited to be part of the new \\'touch\\' technology until i used it. this particular model does truly eat battery time like it hasn\\'t been fed in years. it didn\\'t help that i received the phone w/a battery that expires in 2/2014! my husband bought the same phone and his battery\\'s expiration was 6/2017! which explains why my phone kept shutting down and had difficulty re-booting. i\\'m thinking of investing in a backup charger with a second battery for those days when i\\'m very busy on this phone. i don\\'t make a lot of calls, it more like my \\'second\\' brain.i\\'m disabled and i need to keep more info (reminders, alarms, memos, etc.) than your average user. so blackberry is really the only true cell phone that can handle my needs.at first i thought it was the phone that was dying, then i switched batteries with my husband\\'s cell phone and my phone worked and his stopped! that\\'s when i looked at the \"expiration date\" on the battery, only to discover the big \\'expiration time\\' discrepancy (purchased from the same seller). so, be sure to check the date on your battery before you start switching phones. my husband had to go buy a new battery ($60) just so i could be kept informed on critical information. (i\\'ll leave a comment on the seller\\'s site about this issue.)blackberry is truly a great cell phone manufacturer and i\\'ve owned several models for the last 10+ years. having a desktop app that sync\\'s with outlook is fantastic and the back up capability is the major reason for getting a blackberry..., especially if you have a lot of info and need to set multiple alarms, events, reminders, memos, tasks, etc. no other cell phone manufacturer provides this kind of backup/sync capability..., nor do they allow for multiple alarms, etc. (unless you want to pay $400 and up!).i originally gave blackberry a \"2 star rating\" not just because of the items mentioned above but more importantly because i thought blackberry was dragging their feet in supporting their full features in the \"pre-paid\" cellular market. all of my previous blackberry cell phones had been through one of the top wireless carriers and blackberry supports all it\\'s features if you have a \"post-paid\" account.since we hardly used the wireless carriers\\' lowest package terms, we decided to save 50% and go with the same wireless provider\\'s pre-paid department. blackberry doesn\\'t want to support \"pre-paid\" customers. in fact, they won\\'t support your cell phone unless you are a \"post-paid\" wireless customer! if you need support, expect to pay hundreds of dollars and even then..., blackberry refuses to allow their best features to work as seamlessly as they do in the \"post-paid\" arena. i\\'m a very loyal blackberry customer and i am hoping that blackberry will step up and be the professional company they have been in the past.well, i figured out why all of this phone\\'s functions/features won\\'t work and i owe a huge apology to blackberry. it\\'s at&t that\\'s blocking this phone from being able to use all the features! yes. at&t! if you want this phone to work 100% then you have to get it thru at&t in a \"post-paid\" environment. however, we bought this unlocked phone and activated it through at&t\\'s go phone \"pre-paid\" environment and after all this time of at&t telling me it was blackberry\\'s fault, come to find out..., at&t is making a choice not to offer all features of blackberry cell phones in their \\'pre-paid\\' accounts! not only will they not support all features, but at&t lied to me for weeks saying it was blackberry\\'s fault. i\\'ve been able to talk to blackberry suppoort extensively only to discover they offer all features!at&t has refused to contact me to discuss this issue! i\\'ve escalated to \"management\"..., only to get their big corporate \"run-around\"!at&t apparently doesn\\'t really want to support smartphones. i\\'ve now wasted 5 weeks and i have a fantastic phone that is only capable of half of it\\'s features because at&t won\\'t support blackberry smartphones!i guess i\\'ll just have to keep harassing at&t until this \"step up\" and be the company they say they are!update:it\\'s been a few days now and i now seem to have a more serious problem with the phone. it\\'s set to automatically turn off at night and turn on before i awaken. however, this past week, i\\'ve been awake before the phone turns on and i\\'ve noticed that a few times, it goes through the \\'re-boot\\' process before turning on! this is not normal..., it doesn\\'t happen to my husband\\'s torch 9810. i orginally asked amazon to take the phone back, then changed my mind as the battery was defective. now, it seems the defective battery wasn\\'t the only thing \"defective\". i\\'m in the midst of contacting amazon to see how to work out a return for a defective phone after 30 days. wish me luck.bottom line: i still like the torch 9810 and will get a new one..., one way or another! i don\\'t think i\\'ll buy from same buyer though (gmds-wireless). great phone. works very well. is exactly as described. tested it in the water and it still work! great buy to used in the usa is horrible... phone been plagued with problems just after couple months of using it....blanking out, sticking, keys not functioning.i opened the phone and the amount of dirt in the phone could grow crops. i guess that is what you get for being cheap. slaw. good the phone is exactly what my husband wanted, only the screen is a little darker than his last phone that was the same kind. overall phone is in good condition and works great! my husband does not want to upgrade to the newer kind of phones! this is a great little phone. weighs under 2 oz on my postal scale. one star off for the recessed charging port that others have mentioned (had to take a utility knife to the case). going back to kitkat is a bit weird, but everything works great. i got this as a second phone to take running without weighing me down. switching sim cards takes a bit, but not too bad. too small for me to use as an everyday phone. would buy this brand again. all in all a great deal. nice cannot activate best iphone yet horrible . this was the worst iphone i\\'ve ever bought . i couldn\\'t even connect to my wifi in the set up . total waste of money ! the screen was shattered and i couldn\\'t even get past the set up . don\\'t waste your time with this seller ! just buy an iphone 5s at walmart on straighttalk for $199 ! do not buy this phone!!! no matter what the good reviews say don\\'t take your chances! constantly freezes even when no apps are running and all i do is swipe to unlock the screen! you get what you pay for and its not good! i dont even spend alot of time or effort on my phone and i still cant stand it. freezes for minutes at a time and even getting it to the point to restart is a major pain. sony is awesome. great phone for the price. i purchased this phone and use the ptel mobile mvno for service. i couldn\\'t be happier. this phone rivals all of its competitors but for a reasonable price. the screen is the perfect size and fits in my pocket with ease. the picture is brilliant too. i prefer the android environment to ios and this phone has proven to be a great addition to my environment. highly recommend. bluetooth will not connect to my wireless earphones. it also not as receptive as my old note 2 to my t mobile network. shows only 1 bar or less where my note 2 used to show 4. i hve never seen a 4 bar reception on this phone. excelent great phone, i\\'ve had zero problems with it. i\\'ve had a fancier, more expensive samsung phone and found that blu works just as well, is better prices and comes if more fun colors. :) overall this phone is not for me. it has a few great features though. way to expensive for what you get.it is too small for me and i don\\'t like not being able to delete the apps i do not use.i suggest watching the videos on youtube before you buy one. i sent it back!!!! phone is great. i like better than. $650.00 phones by others. i got this as a trial watch before i get an expensive smart watch to see how much use i would get out of it and i\\'m pleased with the product, for the price it works well with my galaxy s6 it delivers as posted i can and do answer both phone calls and texts with the watch without pulling out my s6 i am content with it and think that soon i will buy a more pricey watch and use this one as a backup. i bought this item early september 2012, been using it ever since. i love the functionality, the look and the keyboard is nice and big! the random shut off problem is super easily fixed (search youtube!) and is due to the fact the battery is built as one back piece. the only major concern i have with this phone is battery life, mine cant seem to stay charged, but that might be just be the reality of having an older phone.. :/i would recommend this phone to anyone looking for a cheaper replacement that feels like nicer quality.cute, great basic phone for the text savvy! the phone came in great condition, it looks brand new even though it\\'s refurbished. the only problem is the battery that came with it will only work while the phone is plugged into the charger. i wonder if this company will replace it since it\\'s refurbished? great phone, bad battery. luckily i have an extra one since i have owned this phone before. hopefully it lasts since i had that phone for 5 years. if they fixed this problem i would give it 5 stars ítem was sent with funny non standard power adapter and additional huge plug adapter. completely unaccetable!. please resend standard power adapter with corresponding return prepaid box. samsung has made an absolutely spectacular phone with the galaxy s7 edge. perfect size; fits and feels well in the hand. easy to use, the touch screen is brilliant, easy to see even outdoors, clear and crisp and the special edge feature of the screen makes this the most beautiful cell phone ever made. and that is just the beginning.the camera in the new galaxy s7 rivals many of the cameras you can buy for hundreds and hundreds of dollars! you can take incredible photos in low light, great videos, even hd video recording and much more. removable storage has come back with the galaxy s7 and now you can insert micro sd cards with as much as 200gb of storage.you pay for high quality and the galaxy 7 isn\\'t cheap. but it is well worth it. buy the new galaxy s7 - you won\\'t be disappointed. its a piece of junk. inclusive the watch damage my cell. this phone is amazing and has so many features that i dont think i will be able to use them all until the newer model comes out.where to start, when you have a near perfect phone!?1. screen is the best i have seen. 5,7 inches quad hd with an amazing brightness just bring videos and pics to life. plus reading the news or even books in this screen is really easy.2. camera is also the best i have used so far. wide angle shots, screen editing etc.3. heart rate monitor and uv monitor.4. battery life is amazing for a phone with this screen and resolution size.5. the pen! what can i say about the pen!! it is amazing, i find myself using the pen a lot more ofter than the keyboard. it has a very high accuracy level for writing or even editing pics plus another array of functions that are really cool.6. design: leather back with aluminum vessel. this phone looks really sexy.7. lightning fastthe bad:1. phone has tons of options, but you have to take your time to dig into them. so if you are not really into this sort of things, i would recommend a phone that is more simple like the lg g3.2. it is a big phone! if you don\\'t have big pockets or a purse to carry it around you may not like it.3. no customizable keyboard.overall this is the best phone i have ever had. it is so fast, the screen is so neat, the camera makes my pics look pro, the pen is amazing for work and for play, and the design is really nice (i would still say that iphone 6 design is a little nicer). i really recommend this product. i used it for about 2 weeks, it was working fine and i was even surprised to see all the things that i could do with it...honestly i would take this over an apple iwatch. i forgot to remove one morning and took shower with it, i don\\'t if that\\'s the problem but now it won\\'t charge so now i don\\'t have a watch i purchased this phone for my 86 aunt because she couldn\\'t see the buttons on that little virgin mobile phone... she couldn\\'t make calls or answer them...so now the whole family is a lot more happier with her new jitterbug purchases for business trip to philippines and it worked fine without a problem. also used to lycatel prepaid service for someone who visited in us for few months. this support only 3g, but you may not feel the big difference from 4g anyway. this can be good for back up on business trips for other countries oitside of usa. very good for what i paid for. excelente great very good product never again, this phone will sometimes not connect to wifi and has to be turned off to charge. it does not come with some of the promised features. if this is the only phone you can afford at the time you may just want to get a cheap walmart phone. my 5140i is 8 years old. still works, the battery still last about 7 days. but the cover totally desintegrated and the chinese aftermarket covers i was able to find don\\'t last a month (the flip out rubber cover at the base the protects the ports falls off within days). so, since i am no fan of smart phones, and frankly there is no other rugged phone (with termometer, compass, flashlight, noise meter) that is available in europe i was amazed to see the new 5140s on amazon.the delivery was prompt, i got it in 4 days.the product however is a nothing short of dissappointment. the \"original\" is made in hungary, in an official nokia factory (no longer exists i think), this one on the other hand came from hong kong. made in china. the batteries, also chinese (two included) last for 2 days (and because the quality of assembly is dismal it doest fit properly), the bottom half (for some reson the keys have latin and hebrew letters too) of the case doesn\\'t attach to the top half (which by the way doesn\\'t have the level to help calibrate the compass).my rating is 3/5, mainly because i want to give it a shot, see how long it will last. so it\\'s based on my love for the brand and the original product. if i was new to this particular phone i would have given it 2 stars out of 5.the op system is slightly updated but no longer has the polar fitness watch support. fast shipping. phone at great price for unlocked phon that is 4g capable. it was a gift, she loves it great phone great device good price, excellent camera of 5 mp, good audio.one of the best 3g i have ever see.default mini sd of 512 mbhigh recommended.the only issue to be aware is his size, everything else is ok. perfect god bless you it is great, runs well hold all my music, camera is great, got apple care plus for two years! all the features of a iphone 6 without the bulky size at first, everything was okay. all apps ran smoothly. the camera was perfect to take a self file or an view picture.but after using 5 months, this phone sometimes shut down immediately although i do not restart or using any strange apps. i reset phone and erased everything, this fault have still repeated.i bought it when i was in usa. now, i comeback to my hometown. what should i do now? i\\'m so worry. let me just say i am loving this phone, i have only had it for 2 weeks and i am learning something new everyday. i really liked my galaxy s3 mini too, but straight talk now has 4g lte in my area and i wanted a phone that also had 4g. this is a great little phone, it is a little bit taller and a little narrower than the s3 mini, but when i put it in the case i can\\'t really tell. it does seem a little faster than my s3 mini. i have gotten two days out of the battery, but i am not a heavy phone user. i play a few games like bejeweled, a little bit of texting, checking email, as an alarm clock and making phone calls. i very rarely use it to surf the web or watch videos. i am probably not the most techy person, but i have to say for my purposes this is a great phone and i would recommend it to anyone who does not want a huge phone, but still likes to have the quality of one. it did come unlocked and sealed, although like someone else it looked to have been opened and then resealed with an official seal. my guess is that shopbest opened it to put in the plug adapter in it, so i could use it in the us without an issue. this is an inter national phone so the plug comes as a 220v and you need to put a converter on it for 110v. this is the mini version not the regular version. i knew all that coming in so be prepared if you don\\'t read the product description to be surprised. phone works just fine, just don\\'t drop it from any, and i mean any, height without a protective cover on it first. dropped mine from 1 foot on to tile and the case cracked apart at the front and back seam. im having trouble linking my texts to the phone. and i guess thats just user error. did not send the product being sent a completely different asked as we proceed in this case? sent another model this watch is junk, syncing is a pain and the pedometer is way off, and will not sync with my phone. you are better off spending the extra money and getting one that is higher quality this phone is everything i expected it to be & much more. i am using a 64 gig card with no problems at all. the kitkat upgrade went with no hitches. the phone responds beautifully at all times. love, love, love my new phone...thanks blu!!!! got phone in time, condition is ok, sides have minor and medium scratches, the front panel was replaced (something stuck under the front camera glass, its visible and annoying, since i see it all the time, but camera works fine).so far everything else works. nothing but good things to say. well designed product. great customer service. battery does not last long before it need to be recharge and there is no warning before the system shut off completely. beautiful and compact, this sweet blackberry is my young sisters best friend, i bought it for her and i have been her favorite brother ever since. its absolutely one you wanna try out. its user friendly and easy to store. just a reminder, the one i have is sim card free, so it can work better within the us and maybe canada or europe. its a great phone... amazing camera!!! good phone!!! i love it so much~ had to return to unforeseen blockage of the phones imei. not google\\'s best..but works good as an entry level phone. it can be glitchy and the storage is awful. works good for people looking for a basic phone. nice phone. i bought it from venezuela and works with every phone company. everything good my mom loved it. brand new, works great, couldn\\'t ask for better 😃 ok i didn\\'t wanna post any review within a few days of my possession to avoid looking like snap judgment. so i had this phone for about a month now and i gotta say i\\'m very pleased with it. the display is so beautiful and the clarity is high. even on low brightness. i thought the screen might be too small for me but it\\'s perfect. i have small hands myself. now i don\\'t have to stretch my thumb across the screen to text messages. i can text comfortably with one hand. the battery life is just awesome!!!! coming from a moto x that could barely last one day, i was afraid the battery life won\\'t be as good for this phone. and i was so wrong. i can easily use this device for two and half days straight without charging it. that includes internet browsing, data using, video and music usage, picture taking and basic calling/texting. remember still turn off your phone once awhile, it\\'s like a computer, it needs to rest sometime. anyhow, the only thing that is not too great about this phone is the camera. don\\'t get me wrong. it takes great and clear pictures. i like the feature that you can choose what to focus when there are multiple things in one frame. the shutter speed sucks. it takes a few seconds for a photo to take a photo. that was pretty disappointing. i did insert a sd card later on and it did help with the speed a little but not too much. but out of all the good things about this phone, i can let one slide. nothing is perfect right? excelente it is my big mistake to buy it.it works well in the first month. then it started to become slow.the touch screen stops to work frequently. i have to reboot it all the time.don\\'t buy it. some some as described for the price this phone is hard to beat. excelente l love the watch, it does everything it was supposed to do.there is one problem with mine and that is i have to hold thepower button down sometimes to get it to turn on, and no itdoesn\\'t start up all over again, it just shows the watch partwhen it finally turns on.aside from that it works great. piece of s*** phone! i waited 6 months to activate - switched to verizon from t-mobile after 15 years of service - and the phone will not work no signal... really!? i have 4 young sons that i need to keep in contact with at all time! doctors, hospitals, appointments! if i could cram this phone up someone\\'s ass i would! this phone is locked by at&t. the phone is only partially unlocked by at&t, therefore you can use the phone on other networks but you cannot use data plans on other networks.side issue: the seller (joycells) is also very slow in responding. sometimes it would take weeks (with reminders) to get a response.technical details:when you set up data on a phone, the apn (access point names) need to be changed. in the operating system on the phone, at&t has blocked the apn from being changed so you cannot change to a different apn (from a new provider).in older versions of the android system, you could run an application that modifies the apn and bypass this lock. unfortunately, android (google) decided to team up with the cell networks and block this option in newer versions of the operating system (like the one pre-installed on the phone), so you cannot unblock the apn.at least for the foreseeable future (until google stops the nonsense), the only way to use this phone with data on a non-at&t network is to \"root\" the phone. rooting the phone has advantages, but you lose the warranty from samsung and the ability to upgrade with kies.it is a good phone, but get it only if you plan to use it on at&t or to root it. thanks ! got to me on time and met my expectations ! love this phone!!!!!!!!!! it is amazing everything about the phone is perfect description was accurate. i received what i expected. phone works great. i bought the phone thinking it was original and began to fail next month, will not work multitasking key and home , nor receive calls . i took it for service and was told that the phone is refurbished and it have software problems, it not accept reinstall software excelente product came with damage to the bottom left of screen which was hard to notice at first so check it over well. i missed return window great device. get this variant of the note 4 if you want it on u.s. gsm carriers such as straight talk, at&t, t-mobile, etc. lte is available with this variant as well. the charger that comes with the device is not for the u.s., but seller did include adapter. the product is gr8. thanks excellent for the price the phone was not unlocked, 4 years later after i bought the phone, i still can\\'t use it. message \" restricted phone\" very good this is a first for me. i have never written a negative review in my life, however this begs to be the exception. first of all, this appears to be a phone aimed primarily at the caribbean market. the primary language is spanish on both the box and instructions. there is also an english translation.i did note when researching the phone that there was a video review that noted the back cover was virtually impossible to remove. i have had a number of phones with removable battery covers, but never like this one. after trying a half hour with no success, i decided to return it. i was concerned that further attempts to pry it off would damage it and render it nonreturnable. the device is very small and very cheaply made i have been a nokia admirer and user for years and i cannot believe this is a product of theirs - or microsoft. my advice is stay away even at this modest price. it\\'s a perfect example of getting what you pay for - in this case not even that. the camera takes fuzzy pictures but otherwise the phone is fine. it was very clean, like new, as advertised but what is with that camera. i bought this phone several months ago and i want to review this item because it is worth buying it.pors: i really love this phone, it stands all my multiple tasking craziness like a hero. it is fast, all applications run smoothly and quickly. the battery is really durable even when browsing youtube, netflix, etc and it recharges in a short time back to 100%. the battery charger is great quality too, and is the preferd one for everybody in the house because is is firm and you are sure it is charging your phone every time you plug it in. i use it in argentina and it runs perfectly with my local carrier.it also inclueded gorilla glass, extra protection shell (golden, i love it too) and it fell to ground many times already (mother of three spirited boys will understand why) and it doesn\\'t even have a scratch!camera quality is good enough and frontal camera is a good extra option for online chats, it includes many editing and selfie options which i don\\'t use but you may like them too.cons: the memory runs out quite quickly, but i added an external sim card and that problem was gone.i really think this is an amazing phone for the price. i would recommend this item to my friends... actually i already did! delivered in combinad ! thank you this phone is great! in almost new condition! really is indestructible! bought this for my dad and he loves it! better price than verizon was going to give me! i bought a new article. the article\\'s descrpticion is \"new\" and the item is refurbished. prices are differente when the item is new or refurbished. i want my money back. the money need to be refund. i am waiting for you answer... i read a lot of reviews (both good and bad) on this phone before i purchased mine. i must say, either my phone was a fluke because everything worked great out of the box, or there are a lot of people out there looking to spend $100 and get a $500 phone! this phone is easy to navigate and set up, has a nice touch screen (i love the included hidden stylus!), and has a lot of features some higher priced phones didn\\'t. the pics and video are exactly as listed - this is a phone, not an slr camera. the pics seemed perfectly acceptable to me as it is listed as a 3mp camera. also, i read a lot about the quality of the mp3 player..??!! it\\'s a phone first and foremost. the sound quality to me is equal to my son\\'s ipod touch using the same earbuds. bottom line for me is that this phone cost less than $100, everything works just fine for me (mms and data using t-mobile), and the added features rival that of higher priced phones of the same age. i need the samsung galaxy s5 just delivered to my wife now in english language pls, or get it replaced or returned to you. great buy considering the price, it\\'s a very nice buy. exelente all ok 10/10 the item came in korean...not very cool at all. it took me hours to get the english version to update for use. so not cool. it works, though, it came with livable but annoying touch screen issues. the top half inch of screen doesn\\'t always register my finger. if you really want a phone like a blackberry, but without having to spend an extra 20 bucks a month for bbm, this is a great phone!my only gripe is with amazon who lowered the price on this phone by 15 dollars, an hour after i recieved it. not cool amazon, not cool. it\\'s amazing it actually looks like a brand new phone and i received it super early 😄👍 i highly recommend it to others i have had many different phones, and this one is comparable at a heck of a lot less of a pricetag. i like the dual sim feature, though it is a bit odd that the sim card slots are two different sizes. all in all i am very happy with my purchase. nice phone, but the camera has poor pic quality good loking phone so ive had my phone since about 1/28/16 and its been working flawlessly! i purchased it with a case and screen protector and still no a scratch. camera has the best quality of any phone ive ever had; audio is crisp and clear. the edge is in all honesty unnecessary but fun to use. you can use it for contacts, speed dial(call text or email), news and many other notifications. if you rub the side a certain way it will tell the time without turning on the entire back light. (good for night time use).my carrier is cricket. i simply bought a sim also from amazon and set it up myself to avoid paying $25 for a $5 job. i usually have 4g signal probably because cricket uses at&t towers. overall this phone is a+ phone nice for the price but earphone jack stopped working within a month great phone it is nice product ok, delivered in time. the phone it is not international unlockedyou can only used as phone the internet part is not open. i do not get 4g or 3g on any internet from my server att aaa+++ nice are amazing!!! the phone i recd was not dual sim. it had a plastic cover where the second sim slot would be. under the cover there was no sim slot. otherwise i cant review the quality of this phone, but under the images of a google search you will find a few of these single sim versions. it\\'s a samsung so im guessing it is a great phone, just be aware some versions are not dual sim. it doesnt work for nothing did not perform as expected. low quality display. i would stick with the lumia products as this one needs much improvement to even come close. not to mention you can get one almost as cheap (i.e. 520, 530, and 640) no samsung pay! i\\'m so happy with my cell it is so good great the old adage \"... you get what you pay for...\" seems to be appropriate here. i returned phone to seller because the screen was not seated flush in the case and actually moves up and down when lightly pressed. got another phone from the seller, same problem. seller says (after i asked) that all their exhibit models are like this. since this is supposedly a \"new phone\" i did not expect this kind of flaw. after about two weeks of going back and forth, i gave up, it wasn\\'t worth it the energy being spent. in addition, the screen just goes black/blank for several seconds before getting to its destination. battery life is awful (even with no apps running). major delays moving from task to task. adjusted settings so screen would stay on during calls, but it still goes blank. phone get very hot on just a single, 20-minute call. volume on calls not good at all. i\\'ve always been please with samsung products, but this time, not so much. i was in a rush to get a phone because my old samsung died. should have taken my time and spent a little more money. great phone! delivered as promised! how you doing dudes? just wanted to quickly share, got my phone, in less than 10 minutes i synched, email, contacts, calendar and heck it works really well here in méxico, so you know, most of the carriers in méxico are gsm, cool stuff, came in a box with all the safety stickers, great phone, perfect size... for the size of my hand i think good very smooth operation. excellent battery life!remains untested internationally but seems to do an ok job! excellent watch at that price! perfectly fits my wrist, good design.connect to iphone 6s smoothly to sync calls, very surprised for the clear sound quality. need more time to check more functions.spend a little more time to connect to samsung galaxy, this watch has much more functions for android os phones but needs to download their apk file and install, it costs more time but made me surprised it can control my samsung galaxy\\'s camera.not tested each function but this watch is really great at that price. 5 star! this phone is great if you want an android phone that\\'s not too expensive. excellent phone: light-weight, small enough to put in a pocket even while in a sleeve, superb contrast in display, great battery life, sound quality, and fast processor. also, samsung has used its top-of-the-line camera in the phone. it is not designed for heavy gaming, video or music work. my only reservation is that the phone is so new in the u.s. that verizon (my first choice) was unable to activate it. samsung hoped to release it last spring to general public, but as of 10/16, they have not done so. on a friend\\'s recommendation, i went to t-mobile for service they easily made it work. even then, they had to go to their tech support to find a way to set up voice mail. within a day, a tech rep was able to send me a sofware patch that made that function work. warning to potential buyers: my phone came from amazon. you must buy a phone that can work in the american networks. if a phone is advertised as \"international\" model, (sweden and great britain have had it available for at least 6 months) be sure you have a guarantee that will take it back if it doesn\\'t work. it\\'s ok poor camera and screen display i have a lot of issues with the phone blocking out on me like right after when i can return the phone, but i\\'m stuck with it and a lot of my apps load very slow. the selphone is super nice ,my daugter love\\'t was her drimss, to have a\\' 5s ,i do loke forwer to buying in other one ,later ,thanks guys it is good value for money, i like to use it as second phone for travel and watching movies.seems quick as of now. will keep posted. it\\'s almost a brand new one,what a great deaaaal great phone overall. i received this phone in black little over 3 days ago. amazing screen and very easy to set up. when you make calls the sound is crystal clear. so far so good, no lags, no freezing. i do have cons though. the battery seems to be running out more faster than any other phone i had. i have metro pcs and i havent been able to get signal like i would get signal , then 4g, then no serivce. i have called both blu and metro pcs and metro pcs on this issue and i was able to get it solved with both. blu has an excellent customer service patient and understanding. i was able to fix the problem and my phone is now working perfectly .out of 10:front camera 8back camera 10screen 10audio 9calling 10speed 10battery 7download speed 9quality over all 9.5 excelent iteam bout insede missing part like head phone ,booklet and warranty informetion , if i can get it before i live for vaction the rest is oky thank for excelent service ,bravo # uno this phone is great.it is a upgrade from an aspire 2. the phone came with all it described hesdset,charger,battery and as it said in the box,unlocked.! charged up the phone overnight and was really surprised at all the apps that were installed.i really love baseball so i installed mlb/atbat,couldn\\'t download the app, put in a call to mlb support and they had me up in 10 min.i like the photo resolution really good photos.this phone is really great for me i text message alot and tweet so i\\'m satisfied with its brightness and clarity ,even the feature i can enlarge the message.only drawback is the battery. replaced the pantech 2g. needed 3g and it does the job. i had been researching for quite some time for an unlocked phone to get out of the contract rat race and found blu products. i ordered the pure xl for myself and the studio energy x plus for my son. very impressed with both. box came with a lot of extras you would typically have to purchase with the other phones. great look, great camera and best of all.. . great price! a high end phone without the high end price. great interface. highly recommended great phone excellent product as expected ..great excelente phones ok ... buy 2 phones unlocked lg and they sent me what they felt like. they sent me one blu phone bone nothing to do with what i asked. they are irresponsible. do not recommend at all.compre 2 telefonos desbloqueados lg y me mandaron lo que les dio la gana. me mandaron 1 telefono blu osea nada que ver con lo que pedi. son unos irresponsables. no los recomiendo para nada. it is not the beat one of cell phones, but i believe that for the price is a very good deal. it has most of nice functions, it works very well and has a nice design. it is possible uptade android system, but not for the last ones. the only problem is that internal memory is very small, although you can use a sd card for some things. recommended if you cant buy the expensive ones. great phone this phone is like having a computer with you at all times, crisp clear screen, very responsive, the dual sim thing isn\\'t needed, just turn it off, also to save your battery, turn off background apps and any other apps you aren\\'t using. once you figure the insides of it, its a good phone.if you have questions, i\\'ll try to answer them. at this price, as compared, is worth it. this product said it was for verizon,but it wasn\\'t even there\\'s. this is my third phone by blu they appear to have a charging problem had to send it back within the first month. quit working. phone battery turned out defective. i had to buy another one. love this phone as hardware is good even though each phone act different. not easy to download apps unless comes with ovi. some setting are different from one phone to another..like web setting one got back arrow and the other got history in the same spot..coz i got 3 already ( not us version, second one dont keep connected to wifi and slow to connect to towers when i drive). in general not as i expected but has a lot of good feature like interent radio..i dunno if i will keep it..its neat phone excellent products high quality and very fast everything as described! reccommend! this is my international phone. it works great.. work perfectly i ordered the blackberry 9530 at the last minute hoping that i would get the product for an upcoming birthday. i contact the shipper and they assured me that i would get the product in time. everything went well the product arrived earlier than expected. on a side note the new unlocked blackberry 9530 works wonderfully. even outside of the united states. thanks for great service i love this phone , but the one i got have a yellow tint screen , i\\'ll return it.update : it was tint at first but now its ok and clear . turns out its a normal things in some new phones. i rushed with the first review. 5 stars they send a phone that was icloud password lock, basic is a useless phone. the phone is amazing, i recommend to buy it, great camera, software, is really fast, the only bad thing is the battery, however i believe that all the android phones are like that, enjoy!!!! great cell for price works international no problems all functions work good deal the phone constantly disconnects from the wifi - it shows an active connection, but no data is being transmitted. wifi has to be disabled and reenabled to resume connectivity. this is a big deal for me, is there a fix and/or workaround? will return if not....ok phone otherwise - expected battery life, fairly updated os, good response time, decent pics, etc... one star, only because i can\\'t give it zero. the phone is a japanese model, which is fine if you have to conform to japanese laws. i\\'m not japanese nor do i live in japan. right away i noticed several features i was unable to turn off because of the model of the phone. entirely unhappy with this purchase. excelent i like it!!! is very good! thanks! i have always been happy with amazon.... if you are a windows/office everyday person and really don\\'t need very specific apps, then this phone works great. i\\'m all about connectivity. calendars, tasks, phone numbers and mails. windows had worked hard to put out apps that make your life easier when dealing with daily chores on your work. office works awesome...real office that is. battery is good. video and audio are pretty awesome too. oh and don\\'t forget cortana (your personal assistant) microsoft said this is the last lumia phone they will ever build and now they are focusing on developing a surface phone just like the tablet, well i own the tablet so i\\'ll be in line for the surface phone. excellent price. fast shipping. i recommend it. 100% recomended screen went out in less than three hours of having it. wouldn\\'t recommend the product. in love with the phone! great phone and arrived early!!! the cellphone came with a scratch on the top-left side ..beside that ,...ok my wife is into talking and texting on the cell phone. she wants no smart phone. just a simple talk and text phone with a qwerty keypad and internet connection if so desire. she also loves the slider part of the phone which makes it more compact and hides her qwerty pad when not in use. great phone for the money! i am so happy to was been deal with youthxu very much, the total time sevice was 2 daywao, i will recommends to every bodies. everything perfect! thanks excelente great product works as new this phone worked for 3 months, now have the screen\\'s touch capability is gone completely. the lower half of the screen has decided not to work whatsoever so i can\\'t even sign in. i\\'m very disappointed because that\\'s 300 dollars that i thought i was putting into a quality product. love it just started using this phone. here are some first impressions. more details to follow. overall, awesome. things i was searching for and i like best about this phone. price: much better price than comparable phones, and this phone is also better in many ways. ram 3g! with a fast processor. rom 64 g without any real boat that cannot be easily removed. net available is about 55g. plus an sd card slot. camera is great, but i am not a photo junkie so you might not love it but 24m is really sharp and better than most at this price. 6\" screen and super vivid. easy to use with reading apps and easy to hold onto. finger print scanner works great. nfc and android pay work great. some of the pre-installed software is actually useful, such as amazon app store and the keyboard app has a number pad. nice things included: silicon case, nfc marks to set up your own nfc commands, headphones like the iphone has. big enough battery. very nice speakers that are about as good as my bluetooth portable speakers. android 5.1. works with my byop, which is currently tracfone, btw i love the warehouse buying option!

[...] a special gift for a relative\\'s hard work in school. i was a bit skeptical at first but i was very impressed. it really is factory unlocked and it works on any network. very impressed with apple express. recommended seller, the product led me quickly and uneventfully long battery life and quick charge. great functions. this lg g3 is fast and the screen is beautiful!i will reconfirm that the 4g will not work in the us on cricket wireless (at&t network). but the 3g connection is plenty fast enough for my needs and i wanted a 1440p screen for under $300 that was also unlocked.having both a user replaceable battery and expandable storage is excellent for users who would like to keep there phone for longer than a year.battery life is good easily lasting throughout the day with average use.software updates could be more frequent, this phone is still on android 5.0. rumor has it that 6.0 will be released to the g3 but we\\'ll have to wait and see.the lg software overlay is very functional and doesn\\'t detract from the experience whatsoever.the camera takes excellent photos and is extremely fast to focus. the camera is beyond what most will ever need in a smartphone,you can even use this phone as a remote control but this feature isn\\'t the greatest due to the poor range.i think this is still the only phone available with a 1440p screen in this price range and the extra gb of ram on the international version is appreciated. i recommend buying a glass screen cover to protect the beautiful screen. the phone came dirty. it works but is cleaning it off too much to ask? my husband refuses to ever upgrade to any other phone. we had to buy a replacement of his original tundra...not because of water damage or being dropped one to many times but because he dropped it on the big island on a mission and a humvee ran over it...two times, and only damaged the screen :) i bought many phones of this model for friends and for my use. all of them were working perfect at the first months. couple of months later problems came with them. mine one used to restart during phone conversations. contact and other applicaions give error and i have to close them. alarm mode does not works. if i try a phone call it takes long to beep or dialing. not factory unlocked to uninstall app not needed. i had the first model and gps works great, this one not. so i would not recomend this model. the big problem looks like to be a model manufactured exclusively for t-mobil and metro pcs. if they are used out from usa there are not posibilities to update when updates are available. i have done root and any how the same problem with update. my last problem at the time. the phone is everything i expected! i have been an iphone user since 2011 and i am not going anywhere! i like its design. battery keeps all day long. it meets all my needs. this was perfectly authentic. my phone does usually die around 5-9% however but that\\'s fine since it is a used phone and little things like that are to be expected. i stuck this baby in an otterbox and stuck a glass screen protector on it. awesome purchase! love phone blu has no lollipop update. excelente official lg great for travelling or just always on the go. a necessity for the g4 power issue. as expected. i love excellent! !! i can use reo línea and have androit and i can install reo lo e from different server the phone does not work, this is a scam... false advertisement that it is an unlocked phone. the phone does not even turn on. thanks it\\'s waaack it did not charge at first then i figured it was the charger. once i got a good charger it worked, well i could make calls on it but it would not ring a call through. i received yesterday, when i installed the simm (wich is working on other unlocked iphone 4 32gb), i realized that it is not unlocked, because the simm is invalid. i need as urgent to solve this problem. please help me !!!!! phone is a christmas present for grand daughter who really wants one but can\\'t get it for herself. i think she will really love it. price was right, packing secure, and delivery fast. saludos, el presente es para dejar constancia que quede bastante satisfecho por el articulo comprado el mismo satisfizo todas mis espectativas i received the package really quick! which was great. now, is the bad news. plugged in battery and my sim card and the phone had to do an system update. the phone would never recover, it kept rebooting and locking up. sometimes it would finish and i would try to browse through the phone, but it kept rebooting and locking up. really! soo frustrating to get a new item and its fried! well anyways, called the so called support number ( samsung ) and it was an automated sales pitch trying to sell me a cruse line ticket!! i could never get through! i had to use google to find an alternate number for support! i have never in my life been so angry, or felt so helpless. you would think that the items you purchase would be tested before being sold. who can you trust anymore? it’s a great smartphone, i’m very satistified with it. had this for a few days now and if it keeps working like it is, great phone for the price. i kept buying no name phones, last one was $200, lasted me 2 years. im hoping this one at least lasts that long. i see a lot of ppl complaining about the battery, i find it pretty decent, all apps working very fast. just turn down the phone brightness. cant seem to figure out how to turn off the vibration for when you type, no big deal tho.for ppl with straight talk, the pre-programmed apn settings do not work.( at least for me) i have the apn setting that gets you 4g, works great. just message if you need the setting. i bought this phone and am using it with straight talk. great phone that is fast and takes great pictures. htc evo 4g phone. new in perfect condition, is working fast and is with full extras. if i can used back home in europe, never woud sale this phone. great product for the price. i am not really using it as a phone as much as i am using it for a gaming device with the added feature of being a phone and wifi hot spot. it was better than i expected and works great on overseas gsm networks. i do not use the camera but the pictures taken were decent if i had to use them. it has allot of features that i am playing with and have i have not been disappointed with so far. i am a iphone person so, i am impressed with its similarity to my old samsung note 3. nice phone, but i returned it due to not being able to receive 3g data on at&t network in my area (edge:2 only). frequencies did not match. if that had worked, i certainly would have kept the phone. screen looked great. responsive. all good, the phone meets expectations, works well in venezuela in all movistar, digitel and movilnet this product has no warranty. it was damaged four months of use and i lost all the money., then the screen went black. the seller did not want to be responsible. excelent cellphone quick delivery excellent product recommend all \\'had the phone for three days - i charged the battery as soon as it arrived (already showing 56% and a \\'manufacture date of 7 months ago!)... now fully charged and in it\\'s third full day of use - battery is down to 48%. yes folks, this battery is a monster. \\'have yet to fully assess the workability of this phone (it\\'s a replacement for my wife\\'s company-owned iphone) but all signals point to it being a great choice. everyone who sees it marvels at the screen res/quality and the up-market look/feel of the whole unit. their jaws drop when i tell them the price!! the box is full of goodies (screen protector... \\'tho we\\'ll be replacing that with a shatter-proof glass one today) and the online manual is easy to print off and use... once you get over the idiosyncrasies of the translated lingo! \\'may be back to add/review this review soon - but, for now 5-out-of-5 to blu phones. this phone is good price and great screen. actually after i bought just before htc one x + released.still i am so glad to have this phone. love it a good productvery nice... broke in 1 month dont buy! perfect thisphone is not unlocked my friend can\\'t use it. phone is brand new and correct e71x. i have had one for 2 years and it is getting worn out. easy to navigate and works well as a phone, and texting which is most important to me. not easily available from att, so now i have a new one for when my old one dies. i refuse to be come a touch screen user! very bad. excelente lovely phone phone has potential but it needs some improvements. i honestly think its a steal for the price i paid. the camera is pretty nice. the quality is pretty good as well but i\\'ve had issues with the software and the keyboard is annoying. the accuration is off on the keyboard and the calibration is weak at times but other than that it\\'s a pretty good phone. buen producto con llegada rápida de atención y tiempo, la especificación deseada sin problemas de contratiempo recomendado este vendedor ok the product arrived on time. after 2 days the battery would not hold a charge for more than 15 minutes. after contacting the company by email, with an immediate response at 8:15pm eastern time, a new battery arrived in 2 days. no hassle and polite customer service. i will definitely use this company again!! excelente this phone is a fantastic value! flagship-level performance at a mid-tier price. best value in android phones out there right now. better than i expected for a used phone,looks new,no scratches,no cracks,very satisfied with the purchase. omg all perfect what is the warranty policy? purchased at end of july but never used it. it does not power on. awesome phone! the delivery coming very fast. bueno this phone look nice i buy new phone but they send me use phone and the apps don\\'t work it won\\'t open. i had to send it back awesome !!!! loving it 💘 doesn\\'t really connect with apple great nexus phone in terms of price for the feature you get bought it for wife and she thinks its nice and does its job well cant really complain no contract phone and instant updates from google wow! i ordered two of these refurbished phones and was surprised at the condition. i looked them over very carefully and could not find any signs of previous use. i have ordered other refurbished phone from the actual carriers that have not looked as good as these. i have not read the other reviews on these phones or the seller, but in my case, i am very well satisfied with the purchase. i have been testing them out for two weeks now, and there has been no malfunction whatsoever. in my case, they look and have been performing as brand new phones. they are set for t-mobile and had no issue setting them up. just put in my sim, and logged in my google/android account. excellent service. the phone arrived on time and complete. product recieved is as discribed. no problem start up. installed activated sim card and phone was ready to use. it doesn\\'t have lte...works as expected but has blackout spots through the out metro areas.. perfect i love my phone the only thing s i can\\'t get pictures messages with metro pcs ... maybe with t-mobile i will try soon pretty cool, atnt no longer works with it since there is no 2g, only tmobile prepay. thanks excelente!! pros:- it\\'s nice and compact. light weight too, so it fits easily in a shirt pocket.- very good voice call quality. as good as my iphone 4.- decent battery life. what a breath of fresh air when compared to the power sucking smartphones that have brought in the age of cellphone cases with battery packs. the initial charge on this nokia led to a standby time of over a week. now, it averages about 3-4 days between charges. this is with mild use since i use my iphone more.- quite a configurable user interface.- it has a immediate screen locking button to prevent inadvertent activity via the touch screen.cons:- i\\'m not convinced the touch screen really improves usability and was likely included as a gimmick to improve sales or potential buyer interest.- the touch screen is just ... ok. the sensitivity is just acceptable and i often end up selecting items while trying to scroll.- unfortunately, some features are accessible only via the touch screen. i wish this weren\\'t the case but....- working with the address book can be tedious since i can search only via the first or last names depending on how you choose to list names, i.e., first then last as opposed to last then first.overall, it\\'s a pretty good phone. i purchased it since i didn\\'t need two smartphones and it has delivered in its light weightedness, simplicity and longer battery life. however, i can\\'t say that i\\'m impressed with the touch screen feature. i\\'m happy to see that simpler phones are still in circulation. the smartphone craze and general feature overkill are getting out of hand. i buy a new phone monthly, or at least i have for the past 5 or so months. after going through and xperia z1 compact, an iphone 5c, a blu life pure mini and another one m7.. i can say without a doubt the m7 is the best phone i have ever used. i sold my first one thinking the sd 600 was dated and having an 800 would make a difference, it didn\\'t.htc put this phone together so well it still amazes me. every aspect of it is perfect. keep in mind tho the colored aluminum is prone to scratches so get a case. i recommend uag.. best case for this phone by far. it came in great packaging with a wall charger, usb cable and headphones, also came with an oem htc micro sim opener (very cool) and a screen protector.the phone itself is in good shape, minus some slight scratching around the front edges.. but after putting the phone in it\\'s brand new uag case you can\\'t see them at all. the first m7 i purchased had the infamous \"puple\" camera.. this one does not, thankfully. my only gripe is i use a net10 simcard so i can\\'t receive updates since this is an unlocked at&t phone.. so i am stuck on android 4.1.2next weekend im going into att and if i can activate it on their service with a garuntee that i will receive the update to lollipop or atleast kit-kat i\\'ll gladly pay the extra 20 a month.if you are like me and are buying an unlocked phone and you want the full package, without spending 300+ dollars, the m7 is for you. its snapdragon 600 with adreno 320 will handle anything you can toss it\\'s way with ease. the camera reminds me of my iphone, which is very rare for android phones.. most of the cameras out there are terrible. the all aluminum body is stellar, and the screen pops like no other phone i\\'ve used, so sharp and bright. (be sure to get a screen protector, preferably tempered glass @ .3 mm) keep in mind that the battery is not the largest by any means and this is an att phone.. so unless you use their service or root your phone with a custom rom, you will be stuck with jellybean.i bought from breed, so i cannot speak for any of the other sellers. they sent out a great unit for the money that included all accessories. the last m7 i bought off amazon came in a week with just the phone and a broken otterbox.. and cost $70 more. but it\\'d had been updated to 4.4.4this will be my last phone purchase for a year or more, buy one now while you can.. htc is a great company that will support it\\'s flagships to the grave. it\\'s big brother the m8 could never quite recrate the rugged, industrial look that i love about the m7 but it\\'s snapdragon 801 is impressive. i will probably buy the m9 next.. but lets see what it has in store first. i know this phone inside and out so feel free to ask me any questions! really liking this case, i\\'m coming from an otter box commuter case and i always wondered if they made one that was one piece. it was $45 at best buy so this was a no brainer to buy it on amazon. to me the case is sleeker than the commuter case and covers the rounded corners of the screen better. i\\'m using it on a 6s plus and it fits like a glove. worked really well for a few months. now the sound only works if it is on speaker phone. at this point i only really use it to access the internet and messenger. for this function it is good. for phone calls and skype it is nearly worthless. especially skype or any app like snap chat it loads too slow. all videos are very pixalated. even when i send them. camera is also pretty crappy compared to other phones i have had. (nexus 5, samsung galaxy3) now that the memory is almost already full (in only 6 monthes) i have to restart it a lot, apps crash a lot/ freeze and the camera has problems. i only purchased because i am living out of the country and wanted a cheap phone that i don\\'t have to insure. for that purpose i believe it has met my expectations. also can hold two sim cards which is very nice as i travel back and forth and need to switch carriers. compared to cost of other phones that i have had before and comparing it\\'s processing to it is good value. 1/5th of the price!!!! the appearance is very nice. even the guy in the cell phone store thought it was an iphone 6. also very durable and comes with a screen protector and case which is convenient and saves money. battery life is good. i charge every night even though it never gets below 50% (unless i\\'m using constantly all day), also charges fairly fast.don\\'t get it you are expecting it to act like a $400 phone. i think it would be a great fit for 1st time smart phone owners. terrific phone. battery life is low side. very good phone, the only thing missing is predicted for texting dealfisher you are the best great phone i bought this for my mom and it\\'s given me problems with it being unlocked and all....it says it\\'s unlocked so why is it giving me problems tho very good i highly recommend you do not purchase this junk phone! i had high expectations and they were all crushed like a crumbled piece of paper. do not purchase! the samsung evergreen may spend most of its time hung up while \"initializing\" the contacts. samsung says the problem doesn\\'t exist. the internet disagrees. i am using my phone as a paper weight now. nice otterboxs are awesome my wife loves it, enough said. goods we paid the \"new\" price for this phone, but the one that arrived was used. when we went to activate with sprint, we were told that the prior owner left a balance owing and that we had to pay that in order to activate the phone. i am trying to return phone now. this phone was just as i was wishing for, but one slight problem (worry). it has a sim card of at&t and it has unlimited text, call, and 4g lte data. so if i use those will i get charged or no? very cheap, looed cheap, dosent do anything worth having it besides to see a text message aomeone sent you. fb or no other app works on it and you can fit a sim card into it even if you take it apart. the micro sd never wors either. worthless buy. the range for calls is very limited. great purchase! i\\'m loving my iphone. i\\'m getting used to my first apple product. ease & comfort comes with this iphone. unable to unlock it from t-mobile, contacted them numerous times to unlock the phone however not unlocked till now, so forced to use only in t-mobile it was very nice thank you so much. and it helps a lot very smart. accurate. sometimes messes up but usually it\\'s just me hitting the wrong button. excellent product and delivery in time! i always have been an andriod fan i love this phone better than my iphone everything works great!! i had to wait a couple of days so my at&t sim card can work but besides that i love it........does anyone knows if they sell the stylus from the phone alone ??? excelente the phone i got was highly used, many dinks on the side. the front touch screen was replaced with after market junk. the touch screen stopped working after two weeks. the wifi and lte data also slowed to a crawl. i don\\'t recommend a used iphone. it\\'s not what i wanted it\\'s not upgradable. it\\'s worthless. hola amigos, compre este telefono con la plena confianza de que recibiria un buen producto mi mayor sorpresa fue que recibi un telefono usado con una bateria china usada y maltratada, el track ball defectuoso la tapa no calza, sin audifonos, un cable de datos motorola y por la caja se ve a leguas que este es un producto reconstruido afortunadamente le funciona el teclado, el pin, pero no es la idea no recomiendo comprar telefonos desbloqueados por esta via. hola, soy de venezuela y debo decir que comprar el telefono fue una excelente inversion.todo legal y nuevo de paquete, todos sus accesorios funcionan. ademas trajo una memoria microsd de 2gb.hello, i\\'m from venezuela and i must say that buying the phone was an excellent investment.all legal and new package, all accessories work. you brought a 2gb microsd memory. to be a 230$ phone, it\\'s amazing! i have a 700$ phone that doesn\\'t even compare!! the camera is just perfect. the phone itself is very sleek and comfortable to use. it\\'s also very very fast. i\\'ve been playing around with it for about 2 weeks and i can\\'t think of a single thing i don\\'t like about this phone. the power and volumes buttons took some getting used to, but i like the placement. the ui of the phone is gorgeous, and super customizable. in short, i think it\\'s a really great phone. nice!! bueno ok i got it today, but i have a worry, my question is , is it open for any sim card from any country? coz i want to send it to cameroon to a cousin. please let me knowso i can order more if you want to text and talk, this is all this phone is good for. sprint started dropping items that this phone could do. my advice, don\\'t waste your time on this phone. great phone great condition had a great experience and will be ordering from them again if ever need a new phone thank you beautiful bud very bad product touch screen working the very next day i received it got good deal for 32gb, but home button did not work. had to pay to change the button. overall the phone works. battery last only a day on standby. the best sellers so far...it fall and the screen is broke overall it\\'s a pretty decent case. my only complaint is that it is loose around the power button and volume rocker. besides that it\\'s comfortable to hold and has a good looking design this is my second otterbox defender, my first being for my first s4. my first otterbox defender saved my phone several times. this case seems like ultimate protection against most everyday accidents without impeding the phones capabilities. sometimes using the fingerprint scanner on the s5 seems difficult, could be because of the case, but i cannot say with certainty because i have not tried it without the case. very good product. worked perfectly with straight talk sim card. i would recomend it to anyone looking for a cheap iphone. just as expected. awesome cellphone, the size is perfect and the responsiveness is as good as it can get. for $300 you\\'re getting way more than what you\\'re paying for.if you\\'re an international buyer, please do check the provider\\'s lte bands in order for it to work as published. nicenewcaozhi works well if you update to android n (7.0), your device will most likely enter in a bootloop because of a \"hardware related issue\", according to google... device is overheating a lot, frezzing up a lot and turning off by itself, i have to take battery out so it can work awesome!!! excellent item the phone is great but there is no instructions with it. it is easy too use it has a lot of good features. this item had no iphone in box box was resealed with some weird black tape only had ear buds and charger in box and box was in japanese horrible fraud good phone buenisimo really can\\'t beat this phone at this price point. if you\\'re sensible and don\\'t care about brand names, i recommend it. the only thing this phone falls shot on, compared to the higher end phones, is screen brightness while you\\'re in direct sunlight. excelente it was a little more beat up than the picture showed. it does work fine on the other hand :) this phone is amazing! i love it. it got 13 mp camera front and rear which is working awesome.the touch is very nice smooth.but you don\\'t have much options for case. the screen is crystal clear and feels like real. it\\'s worth for what you pay. fino it\\'s not good..it\\'s hanging...seems like software is too slow i like the fact that you can play your music from your phone on the watch and the speaker is pretty loud for music and voice calls. it look and feel good too. you can put your sim card in the watch itself and put your phone in the drawer! i like the practicality. great buy!i would highly recommend this watch to others. good deal!! thanks, this phone is nice first android phone that i bought and i really like it is fast and easy to use. had an iphone for the last 5 years. but i really like this phone battery life is nice. i\\'m not a heavy user right now because of were i am working but the battery is great. sound good as well. i really like this phone. phone worked for two days then just blacked out! not sure i\\'d buy another refurbished product. this is the second phone i have purchased, and the phone has went out plus when someone calls u can not hear them, getting ready to send it back nice el telefono llego bien! la tienda responde y manda todo al dia! el detalle sq como es blackberry se funde rapido no aguanta pela es muy delicado!! es bueno para gente q no le saca la chicha a los telefonos desde venezuela it work only for two weeks . after two weeks its dead. mp3 did not work and blue tooth too. not really recomended. its a waste of money. excellent great phone, only cons: yo can not use the wifi spot in this att phone, as this feature is blocked. best phone ever :) excelent phone phone was advertised as unlocked, and dealfisher assured me it was compatable with my carrier. but neither came true so i had to return it. had it not been a christmas present... blackberry storm2 9550 unlocked phone is a great product for me and the kind of activities that i realize... i recommended it did not work at all. the screen just stayed on white the whole time. i was cautious about ordering a phone from a second party like this, but i was very pleasantly surprised at the service and the quality of the phone. the phone is very nice. there are no scratches anywhere. it works perfectly. i was also contacted by the company about a week after i received the phone just to be sure that it was received fine. they were very professional. i have recommended them to my friends. it works perfectly exellent takes clare pics awesome resolution. but the performance of the phone has some lacks..you can see the previous screen everytime u hit the back bottom it gets really annoying to see the shadows of your previous screen. fine nice phone, good price. had a lil were and tear but the phone is great .buttons all work.calls texts,nd holds a gr8 charge..i recomend this phone. great phone a must buy it was everything i expected it to be and arrived before the date amazon had set. bought this cell phone in january and now it beeps all the time as if being charged. this causes the battery to drain really fast and the only way to stop the noise is to set it to vibrate. i\\'ve formatted and updated everything but it keeps beeping. i read on the net of several people having the same problem. also the battery icon shows it to be charging even though it\\'s not.really disappointed in the quality of the hardware, wp 7.5 is great though. nobody buys a cell phone expecting it to last 9 months for god\\'s sake!!samsung never again!! after 3 month only the vibration stopped and not working anymore !!!! doesn\\'t have a camera and can\\'t bluetooth was different,flashy and the talk of all my friends,not expensive like the over rated \"galaxy\" cellphone watches! a real good choose. great phone for the price. in perfect condition works wonderfully, no problems! excellent! !!! good phone for the dolars spent touch pad is not so quick especially home and return buttons cam is decent battery on standard micro sim is used battery not remvable gets hot when used with multi tasks im very happy with my bb and the service amazon gave me. i had a problem with my first shipping...no bb in the box, i was shocked. i called and they sent me a new one. now im happy! thanks amazon for helping me. it\\'s a excellent product and it was on time. i recommend it a lot wife wanted a cheap android phone to go back to when she got feed up with the nokia lumia 900 she had. for her to go to this meant she hated the lumia 900. she really didn\\'t hate the phone just the reception issues that plagued her lumia 900. with this phone the issues are gone and she can play with a bit more apps then what she had before. thanks for the item, its great the item appeared to be slightly used, re-packaged and not brand new in box as advertised. box was not sealed but had been opened and sim card had been installed but nevertheless acceptable. the charger port quit working after a month of having and the screen always goes black! i purchased this cell for my sister as a birthday gift and she loved it! it was easy to set up and she hasn\\'t had a single issue with it yet. she loves how fast it is for all her online browsing and social media updating. a great buy for sure! great phone no issues for me due to some discussion about very different flavors of this phone being shipped by different sellers, this review is for a phone sent to me by unlocked cell phone kings inc via amazon. delivery was prompt and the item was in brand new condition (if it wasn\\'t they sure did a great job making it look that way). mine came with a very brief manual (if you want to call it that) in english, with the phone set to uk english. this is my first even semi-smart phone, but i have some experience as an android tablet user so it wasn\\'t all new to me.i have several usb cables with male usb mini connectors. this phone uses a usb micro connector for charging and data transfer so i bought some mini-to-micro adapters so i could use the stuff i have, but the adapters turned out to be useless. the female usb micro port on the phone is recessed in the housing such that the male usb micro fits only if it will fit inside this very, very small housing. the adapters i bought, though small, were too big to allow the male plug to be inserted deep enough into the female to make a connection (or even stay in place - they fall right out). i\\'m thinking i\\'m going to have to get genuine samsung cables from somewhere but haven\\'t finished looking around yet.the power adapter, which has the proper size usb micro male on it, is a european plug design and it comes with a plug adapter, presumably so it can be used in the us. while you can indeed plug it into a 110/120v outlet in the us with the adapter, it has absolutely no effect on the phone. it doesn\\'t charge at all. i\\'m guessing it expects more voltage, but whatever. the cable is built into the transformer and so is useless as a spare data or charging cable. also, apparently not all charging cables will transfer data as well as charge. be careful when looking at charging cables or kits to make sure you get one that can both charge the device *and* transfer data between the phone and your computer. if it just says it\\'s for charging, it is probably not for both purposes.that means that this package contains one and only one usable cable for charging and data sync, via a standard usb connection on the pc side of things and a micro usb male on the phone side. you will probably want to plan to buy a spare or two but i don\\'t have a recommendation on that yet because the usb micro female port on the phone won\\'t accept just any usb micro male. it has to be in a really, really small housing.i couldn\\'t use the camera app or install the amazon app store (or several other items) until i put a 32gb micro sd card in the phone (all 32gb were recognized). get an sd card installed before you start trying to install much of anything; it solves a number of problems.the android market and the amazon app store initially reported that several apps were not compatible with my device. i downloaded and installed samsung kies on my win 7 home premium 64 bit machine with no problems. then closed it down and started it again and it asked if i wanted to update it and i said yes. so it updated, and then asked if i wanted to upgrade the firmware in my phone. i said yes. after i did this (by this point i had already installed the sd card), app installations have been smooth as silk, even the often aggravating words with friends which seems to decide that any device you have is incompatible about every other week.i recommend you look for \"app2sd\" or a similar application that allows you to move (or which automatically moves) applications to your sd card instead of letting them hog space in the limited onboard phone memory. some apps must live in the phone but others can live on the sd card.i had trouble with the bluetooth phone application in my car (a late model hyundai) and found that others have too. i paired the phone with the car successfully and could make and receive hands-free calls through the system with no trouble. i could not get my phonebook/contact list to download from the phone into my car, though. after much aggravation and searching, i found a post on a board that suggested a free android app called bluetooth file transfer. download and install that app; start it; hit menu; hit more; hit send contacts; select all (or whatever you want); hit send as single. the app blasted my contact/phonebook list out into the ether where the car saw them floating around (the car was configured to auto-download) and sucked them all in. et voila! yes, i do have to remember to refresh the car\\'s copy from time to time but i can live with that.the screen scratches pretty easily; you may want to consider a protector.and oh yes, i bought a 1500mah battery because of so many people saying the battery life was lousy. at least for now, my battery life with the originally supplied battery is excellent imho with bluetooth and wifi on 24/7. but you always need a spare battery lying in a drawer somewhere.this sounds almost like a list of complaints but i don\\'t mean it to be. i like this phone and would recommend it highly. all i need now are a few cheap cables and a few accessories, which i always seem to need when i get something like this. it has taken about a week of on-again, off-again diddling to get it largely where i want it, but that\\'s not unreasonable for a new tech toy. if you are new to android expect it to take a bit longer, but that\\'s not the phone\\'s fault - it\\'s just how it is. i hope some of these comments are useful if you are considering or have bought this phone. this iphone 6 plus, 16gb/unlocked came with a 60 day warranty & we had no problems with it in those 60 days. in the 30 days that followed, the phone began crashing. it had green/black screen that would flash a white line and then appear to be asleep. the phone would not wake from this screen. we did a hard reset(pressing home key & power key simultaneously) and then plugged into itunes to restore. restoring worked a few times to wake the phone or to actually restore it. we contacted the seller (solar tech llc) and amazon, so far we have only heard from solar tech who told us we were out of warranty & therefore out of luck. we then took the phone to the apple store who told us that it could not be restored. they would gladly repair it for the out of warranty fee of $329 or we could trade in our $500 broken phone and pay $300+ to purchase another refurbished phone w/ a 90 day warranty. we left the store w/ our broken phone and then ordered an iphone 5 from a different seller on amazon. we will wait for the 7 to come out and possibly replace the 6plus when the prices come down. if you have an issue report it immediately, do not wait like we did, hoping it would get better. i love it el producto me vino en muy mal estado y las piensan estaban usada. estoy muy descontento con el producto comprado the quality of the actual product was very nice and sturdy. the only problems i had with this product was that the bluetooth kept disconnecting every few minutes. the step counter would reset every so often without me prompting it to. wow... i love the cell phone... 💜 i bought this when it came out. i liked the phone but after it stopped working i was not able to do anything. i contacted amazon, the seller, nothing.i contacted samsung us because i live in us, they did not do anything because it is international model manufactured in england or india. they gave me phone # to call after many phone calls. india number was very weird so i contacted samsung uk. people were very nice but deflected me to some web site uk and said they do not accept packages from abroad. so i sent it to my mom in eu. she send it then to uk. and even though samsung\\'s manufacturers warranty is 2 years they did not fix my phone! even though it was less than 1 year old. anyways they all toss it around like a hot potato. i thought it is samsung - meaning every official samsung branch i take it to should take my phone and fix it even if they have to ship it to china! what is manufacturer\\'s warranty? nothing? excellent product best phone for the price. i truly love this phone it has a large bright screen its fast and is thin. the only drawback it has is the camera is not that good. pretty decent product at a very reasonable price great phone, though not eligible for google android 7 \"nougat\" update from google. but still a fast phone, great screen, supports qi wireless charging (on google, lte, or third party qi chargers), and cases & protectors are now quite affordable as well. still a solid backup phone or a low-cost-to-replace secondary phone. last google factory image as of this writing is 6.0.1 marshmallow, m4b30x. not good very practical phone: large screen, lightweight, and high sound quality. love this phone! easy to use and all apps i have loaded have worked flawlessly! this phone was a hell of a value when you compare its features and benefits as compared to other more expensive models! you needn\\'t look further than this phone! i m troubling with this phone really i hate this its keep on rebooting and its getting heat if i talk more than 5 mins and battery life is not good. perfect. the phone came with all the accesories. nice it fitted perfectly on my note 3. i have installed the iloome 9h, and the edges of both fit exactly. excelente the 5 stars is not because this is the best phone ever... i do however feel it was the best deal for the money. from the little time i have had the phone i do notice the battery, once in use, goes quickly, but for my needs no real issue as i mainly text. was concerned about problems using a tracfone sim card and the number transfer took a long time but again no hiccups.the phone is clear, runs apps better than my old lg. hooking my wife up with same right now as early christmas present. very impressed so far. it\\'s a beautiful phone. not new to me because i\\'ve owned iphones for a number of years, the last one being a 6 plus. great works for iphone 6 to split the audio in and audio out of the phone to two phono jacks for connection of external devices such as a wired speaker or microphone. there are so many things that i liked about this product, that it is an easy spend for me. here are the pros and cons:pros:* screen resolution is fantastic. i really wanted my phone to be 1920x1080, but even if this phone is not, the ppi is high enough to give a crispy look.* bought myself a 32gb micro sd card, i have been able to load most of my apps and songs without any problems.* the device has dual sim card, which is quite useful as i travel quite a bit internationally, and don\\'t have to sit at airports and change sim cards.* speaker on this phone is quite good! to a point where i listen to music just like that! (without even headphones)* battery life is superb! fully charged phone with about 40 - 50 minutes of call and the data line \"on\" all the time, lasts for about 2-1/2 to 3 days. [yes, i prefer to use cell phone only for the purposes of quick communication and not as a long time use device for phone calls. that is what land lines are for :-) ]* windows 8.1 phone works very well on this device.* comes with the gel cover, which really protects the device and fits snuggly. no need to spend another $10-$15 on that.* looks very nice too, thin and weighs very less! people do take attention to the phone!cons:* the processor is a low-end processor which does affect the performance when dealing with laborious tasks. (for example, when using owa, if there are 200+ mails on the inbox unread, zooming in or zooming out takes a few seconds of delay (whereas, i don\\'t see that issue in my nokia 920). similar problem when using \"swipe\" keyboard.* doesn\\'t support lte, which reduces its use for me when i am in us (at&t network)* i am not sure how the device software update is going to work, will have to wait and see -- since it is not carrier attached.overall, great worth, and would whole heartedly recommend to any one! my wife surprised me on father\\'s day with this phone and i couldn\\'t be more pleased. it is well built with a beautiful display and the class leading blackberry keyboard. sure, it is missing a few android apps but that\\'s not a deal breaker. the hub is a great single source for all your notifications. i also own a passport and now have the best of both worlds. the phone was great and met all of my expectations. thank you very much. i had to send this phone back to the seller. it was dirty when i got it, so i thought, since it less than $40 a little clean up wasn\\'t bad. also the slider to open the keyboard was sticking. had to really clean that part of the phone?? i set the phone up, and was ready to use it. the last thing i tried to do was call out. everything was good except for that very important feature.live and learn. what a nice and elegant phone!! at first, i had difficulty choosing between this model and the edge one. finally, i choose versatility and a practical phone. edge is fashion, but in the daily use, i felt it was going to be bigger and uncomfortable to hold/carry.this phone is very fast, just what i wanted. 4g in argentina is fast, so i can netsurf at high speed. i\\'m very happy with this purchase! great samsung product! the sound on this phone/wtch is great. enjoying it very much. es de excelente servicio de buena calidad sus productos con una rápida entrega y sin inconvenientes alguno, 100 % recomendado great phone.. i like the phone but it\\'s really not anything i can do with this phone is very simple, but gets the basics done with orderly and quick fashion. it has pretty fast wifi and also a 5 mp camera. it does have a few flaws though. the camera does not have flash and the touchscreen is rather poor.buy this product if you want a really basic wifi phone that works well and is reliable. i love it have had this phone for quite some time and purchased it because it could be used with the straight talk service. received it quickly with easy to use set up and instructions. excellent product, recomended 100% so after using this phone for a while now, i\\'ve come to a conclusion that this is a great phone for the price i paid. there was just a new system upgrade so the phone works faster and the video quality is awesome. and also don\\'t buy a phone case because it comes with one already in the box. excelente teléfono i got this for my brother for a christmas present - haven\\'t heard back yet, but no news is good news (^_^) just as i expected. surprisingly looked brand new. came earlier then i thought it would. i have always purchased less expensive cases, and was always happy. i was really impressed with this case. i wear it at work and i have a very physical job and the belt clip is holding up really well i love my phone and good price for it excellent this cell phone has a wow about it. i love everything about it...no complaints from me. just hated i drop my phone in water and it still ran for a good month before dying on me. i will be getting me another one soon. having slippy fingers don\\'t let you enjoy the cell phone....lol. on the serious note \"a damn good cell phone. i bought one of this and the gps didn\\'t work. i return it but before i contact the brand and i they do not help in anything. be careful this cell have great specs but the quality is not very good. please notice, sprint only very good, authentic unopened iphone 5c i like this phone works perfect nice i completely love my new iphone!! it came with no scratches and right on time! no complaints at all. it was unlocked and i had no issues with connecting with my carrier. thank you soooo much 👍 nice little phone. love everything it works wonderfully couldn\\'t be more happier after reading some of the other reviews i was kind of worried it would not be in great condition, or it would have a big scratch or button that didn\\'t work. that was not the case, the phone came in almost perfect condition, and after taking it to at&t it was unlocked and i was up and running in no time.i am very pleased with this purchase, and the price was fantastic! hi i got samsung s6 todaynot much explored the phone but 2 things observed1) battery is very hot after few mins of charging , is it safe or should i return back ?2) at the back of samsung phone , samsung 6 is not printed . is this original piece . how should i verify ? crappy phone 3g doesn\\'t even work. wish i could get a refund. wish it worked right. already had to buy a new phone. good great guy. very helpful! this was a very good purchase! truly certified refurbished! not just cleaned up and sent out. works great! thanks very much, and i will certainly feel free to buy from this seller again! great buy. seller shipped it to me very quickly and it was in great condition. exactly as posted. awesome, works well this is truly a one of a kind phone. and it does everything it says it does. i was surprised to discover it does receive text messages you just can\\'t send them. the seller (cbs) wasn\\'t sure if it would work on the at&t network but my prepaid at&t sim card worked fine. i got a \"sim card registration error\" with my t-mobile sim card however. this phone is very unique and simple to use and it will turn heads. i\\'m a happy customer. you can see the crack above the home button. it runs up by my arm you can see the crack clearly didn\\'t like it and returned it while the phone has a quality feel to it and a very nice display, i was very disappointed with the ear piece. for some reason the ear piece is off set. mean it\\'s not in the middle of the phone, so you have to awkwardly place your ear on the right side so you can hear the person on the other end. also i was in areas that i got excellent service from my older phones and for some reason this phone would constantly lose service. i immediately returned this phone and ordered something else. amazon smartphone and good seller great phone! what can i say, the e71 is great! the build quality is outstanding, a very solid phone with no squeaks or loose parts. the only thing you need to do is get the new firmware update which was released in early dec. \\'10 & then your good to go. not the same quality as galaxy s5 lousy phone. has no mobile data connection no matter what i\\'ve tried to do. doesn\\'t get sms on time. had to spend 3 hours with a support representative just to open it. i\\'m really disappointed. was bent a little bit when i got it just perfect love my blu phone. i converted from iphone 5. i am not disappointed. some of the button placements could be a little more convenient. but overall an excellent phone. right out of the box , after inserting sim card . says searching......that\\'s it . stupidly, i bought a second, pink one , thinking it was a different brand . it doesn\\'t work either. awsome colors product was as described a great buy a++++ excelent extremely good reception and wifi, however trying to find a case cover was difficult. accidentally dropped mine so as a remember, order a jacket to protect the phone if you can find one that will fit.dg love it \"un-fixable\" problems with the sim card port. the phone just cannot read the sim cards. technicians just can\\'t fix unless it is sent back to nokia.. this product missing a lot don\\'t even have a stop watch,calculator plus i pay for 2 day shipping and got in 3 day s the phone does not work with my tmobile sim card. the iphone is good! but i have an issue the headphones are \"fake\" plastic not rubbery like the original i expected better but its ok! motorola razr v3m arrived in in good shape and on time. it came with a charger but the battery doesn\\'t always hold a charge. very good phone for the price very good great no problem today i jzt take a pic with the phone trying for the first time the watter resistence and is totally fake so if u r looking for a phone that can do this keep looking my phone gets crazy and lost the volume and the sneaker also the screen was damagei purchased this in february so i have no longer garanty but i think this post will help to futures owners have been happy with it. service was great, iphone is a 4, all i could afford, and slow compared to my 4g. still, i like the phone. great product. everything as expected after being a happy android user for years i decided to make the switch to this phone. i am very happy with the build quality. the screen is bigger than my nexus 4 with nice color just one word: wow! i like this phone for the larger buttons for texting. it works well in the holder i have and it is not cumbersome. perfect as a work phone. you are better off with two cans and a string!!!! this is the worse phone ever! the first one i thought was a glitch. it was horrible. kept closing out in the middle of conversation, battery would not hold and after receiving so many emails would get warnings that it was too much and couldn\\'t process?? blah, blah, blah... so i sent it back and got a replacement. it stays on, emails work fine and the battery is great. that\\'s it. you have no memory because it has so many apps that are permanent - you don\\'t have a choice - that take up all the memory!!! but wait you say, you bought a 8 and it has dual sim capability. me too. so i bought a sim, installed it but nothing can be transferred to it because there is nothing on the stupid phone to direct you to switch over. so i got a 30 ready and willing but unable to use. what you say, the instruction booklet is one the permanent apps? you are right! but under dual sim is says, you have one. next subject!!! the instructions are non-existent, the dual sim is worthless, the dump kiddy apps that are permanent are ridiculous for an adult. this is my second third blu. the first two were great but now out of stock. this one is of no use. yes, campbell soup, here i come! i absolutely hate this phone. it works pain-stakingly slow. going from one app to another takes about a minute. also sometimes the keyboard wont show up times when i\\'m trying to input information. lastly, all the apps crash and its frustrating. i would excellent!!! excellent smartphone phone didn\\'t work. returned the item and never got money back great phone?!!!!! very good phone this phone was ok at first but it keeps freezing and restarting. i\\'ve only had it for about 3 days now. haven\\'t downloaded anything or added any service yet. its just factory mess up\\'s causing it to have issues i guess. still not happy about this though. excelent. recommended 100% exelente gracias work perfectly! nokia needs to add some assembly required. the sim card slot comes with the package, not installed in the phone. it is not a big deal and it is simple to install, even if you think you cannot install it you can, even if you refuse to install it your service provider will install it. the card slot takes 5 - 10 seconds to install; however the problem is this:when you purchase this type of phone it is never purchased by itself. there are screen protectors and cases that go with it. in general people do not read instruction manuals for phones, unless of course there is a message of some assembly required.other than the card slot, this is an incredible phone. the apps are growing every day, between nokia, microsoft, and at&t (my service provider) i have 3 industry leading companies providing me service. here is the bottom line even with is type of os in it\\'s infancy google will never beat microsoft, nokia has been an industry standard since inception and as for bell laboratories they have an incredible track record for engineering and innovation. when you buy technology you go with leaders not imitators. this was not an unlocked t mobile phone-i have to call to get them to unlock it-i am just throwing it away. buyer beware do not buy! just throw your money else-ware. this phone is the best phone anyone could ever want i will never go back to samsung meet your expectations. overall is a great phone, i am huge windows os fan. was able to upgrade to 8.1 immediately which was a huge plus. however, on the first day the phone locked up and had to hard reboot it. i have dropped it only 2 times on carpet, sometimes it gets really hot and freezes randomly. the features are great, love the yellow. i just bought and i love it.the screen is really crisp. it is a great phone overall. had to return it very very cheap phone..u get what u pay for it works fine until the cursor starts going bad. getting stuck and not allowing selection. since it\\'s not easy to transfer data from 1 unit to another, i got stuck with it. now i really have to replace it. excelente total waste of my money! phone never worked a day! loud noise whenever you try to make a call! factory defect! useless! please do better seller! i have never had a smart phone before and i absolutely love this. it came so quickly and is absolutely a blast to use. thank you. worked great ! was easy to get on a prepaid card and switched carriers with no fuss. cool watch ! the phone dials numbers while i try to backspace. their is also a glitch in the screen. also the phone screen goes blank excellent. incredible device for the price, one seller (cellstore33) has your back. exceptional!i\\'m extraordinarily happy with my product. it was listed as \"very good\" condition, but i would consider it \"like new.\" not a single blemish on the item. extremely high quality at a fair market price. exact match for the product description.some people hate android skins, but i love the little touches of htc sense. media streaming (dlna) built in, a great music player, car mode triggered by dock\\'s hardware cable, lock screen optimizations, flip for speakerphone, and all kinds of other small optimizations for android. these really make for a superior user experience.if you ever have an issue on an order from cellstore33, rest assured they will bend over backwards to solve it. the shipping carrier for never registered a scan for the original tracking number, even after a week. within a half hour of contacting the seller, i had a response that a replacement was in stock and would be sent out that same day. no fuss, no pushing necessary, no trying to further chase the original before helping me. my needs as a customer came first, and indeed the replacement shipped out that day. i received a personal email as soon as it shipped.furthermore, as part of solving the problem, the seller proposed a generous remedy for my inconvenience. the seller then checked in twice more before delivery to make sure my needs were being taken care of. once more afterwards to make sure i was satisfied. if an issue comes up, what more could you ask for?given the attentiveness, extraordinary service, and generous remedy received when something went wrong, i would not hesitate to order again from this seller. if i have a friend searching for an unlocked device down the road, i know exactly where i will send them. i was ok, hated it for me though, i sold it for a lot less then i had paid for it, seems like a lot of people did not like it either. oh well you live, buy and learn from your experiences i start by saying, i love the screen its large enough for me to see with glasses or without glasses. everything else us great, except you have to wait for the united states networking to kick in, because it\\'s shipped from hong kong everything doesn\\'t work properly at first. but after twentyfour hours it\\'s all foid a+++++ excellent product and i really liked my expectation filled the qualify because everything arrived as requested i really i liked all the pretty enough to recommend to all the community through amazon not change. excelente the phone gets really hot. i had to program it myself in order for it work on my network (att) the quality of the phone is excellent . the speed is very good. overall the phone is awesome. my only complaint is that when i received it the seal on the phones box was all ready opened and ther was all ready a screen protector installed on the phone. so i believe it had been used and returned before it was sold to me that\\'s good ítem definitely unlocked and works well in my country. teléfono bonito, pero de baja calidad, pixeles muertos, botón en mal funcionamiento, software se pega al transferir datos, cámara muy mala. no lo recomiendo.nice phone, but low quality, dead pixels, button malfunction, software sticks to transfer data, very bad camera. would not recommend bought this phone for my teenager after getting tired of spending ridiculous amounts of money on the \"latest and greatest\". i have had no regrets. the iphone has worked great and saved me hundreds of dollars over the price of the latest iphone. very good it is a good phone if you want to get away from the technology of the smart phone. works well. not worth it at all; the only thing it is good for is...nothing...don\\'t waste your money. it doesn\\'t have the memory it says it does, the battery drains in like under an hour, not a good choice at all. awesome phone new in box wow, wow, wow...i\\'m so terribly disappointed with is purchased! i decided to give this as a christmas gift for that special woman in my life however a good deed, thought and gift has turned into a nightmarish experience. i\\'m not sure if it\\'s samsung\\'s fault for not having better measures in place to prevent false chinese copies of their phones leaking into their inventory or if it\\'s a planned ploy to get over on less educated customers. also i think amazon hold companies passing off fakes via their website to the highest level of responsibility because it does affect one\\'s thought towards making future purchases of certain items.yesterday after opening this gift my loved one plugged it up to charge the battery as anyone would do, but when we return later that evening i noticed immediately there was a problem when the recharge light was still red. so i unplugged it, removed the battery for 1 minute, and revered the process again, but there was no change for it appeared as though the phone wouldn\\'t charge. my lady unplugged the phone and powered it up, but she couldn\\'t get past the \"language selection\" menu which was english (uk) only so she asked me to look at it. i attempted to navigate through the phone without any success. when i pressed start the phone did nothing and when i hit the power button the phone shown only \"turn off and restart\", but wouldn\\'t do either when selected, so i had to remove the battery to shut it down.the next morning after breakfast i started doing online research into the problem after booting the phone to the android rom upgrade window. first before entering that screen a window appeared and all of the characters were written in chinese versus korean. as a veteran that have served overseas i can clearly distinguish many of the asian languages from one another especially korean which is more distinctive. also i work as an it specialist and have been in the field for over 20 years. i downloaded the latest versions of kies and smart switch, but neither software would recognize the phone and at that point my suspicion grew even more. i started conducting a search online of the \"odin mode - product name: sm-g9006v\" and then is when i discovered i\\'d received an etremely well made and professionally packaged chinese made samsung galaxy s5 knock-off!i\\'m glad the events that occurred happened otherwise if everything had functioned as it should have i\\'d probably never ever known i\\'d purchased a chamsung calaxy s5! no offense to anyone chinese!i\\'ve added photos to substantiate my claims. amazon please post this for it would be in the companies best interest to let other prospective buyers beware. i want to give samsung and amazon a fair chance at righting this very wrongful act before taking to social media. i like it a lot thanks blu studio c mini quad core, i had this phone for over 3 months now ,totally disappointed and unsatisfied ...it doesn\\'t connect to data! ,doesn\\'t download media messages! or any attachment like contact ,file ....,doesn\\'t connect to wifi in free wifi places! can\\'t return it now ...totally waste of money ! it says unlocked but you cannot use for gsm carriers.they try to convince that you can but it will not work. very good phone. the only problem is that most apps are not made to work with windows. a way to force people to use android and apple products which are not better than this windows phone. nothing to say. worst device ever. this item works as described but i have become accustomed to a more advanced user interface on a cell phone. love it it bad i get everything they say i would no bull i would recommend this phone to anyone. excellent phone was just used as a replacement until new phone could be purchased. it was ok. it was a described. good price. god smartphone! identical to blu advance 5.0, for the price you can not demand more, it is a good entry-level smartphone, large and bright screen, camera ok, nor has frontal flash as indicated by the publication, recommend it! utterly disappointed. didn\\'t even have the phone for 24hrs and it started shutting off automatically. now it won\\'t even come on. i tried the 120sec forced turn on and that didn\\'t work. i love sony phones, this is my 7th sony and i can\\'t believe that this happened. i\\'ve found forums that say that the problem is the battery and it needs to be replaced. if i get the battery changed and the phone does the same thing, that\\'ll be $280.00+whatever the battery and installation costs, gone down the drain. i\\'m very disappointed. i love my samsung! it is just a great phone over all. it is a good size, not to big, not to little. good sound quality. it has plenty of storage for music, videos and any apps you may want to add. wonderful ,quality phone delivered as promised ! i am completely satisfied ! i love it. and it works with metro pcs. yay. good phone. i mean great one, but if you\\'re looking for battery life, don\\'t buy it. it last like four hours for a busy woman like me. very good bluetooth wouldn\\'t connect to anything. constant error messages. wouldn\\'t show pictures that i took using the camera. sent it back for a refund. it\\'s a little bit difficult to use the android sys at first time. but when i am familiar wiz it, i\\'d like to use it every time. good quality, nice sounds, fast sys and multiple apps. it a great phone for its price.i have no problem with it.its great for playing games and watching videos and movies.the camera is not that bad,but also not good.i dont take alot of pics so i dont care.the speaker is not that loud.my iphone 4 i have was louder that it.the headphones that came with it work great.i have no problems talking and texting on it.i think some day iphone will probably make there phones this big. works great had some trouble getting my data to work at first but all good now it\\'s has almost the same features like the other brand name phones such as the samsung galaxy love it!!! came in excellent condition!!! this a great phone i\\'ve brought this because i was looking for a budget phone and this phone meets my needs. the problem i\\'m having is the bluetooth goes out for a second when streaming music which is a bummer since i\\'m a music lover. another thing is the volume is extremely low as others have said when using speaker or just talking on it. this is the reason i gave it 3 stars. the iphone heats up & battery dies too fast & i only had it for 2 weeks, supposed to be new but it don\\'t seem like it. from internal conditions. looks great, don\\'t work great:( excellent nice blacberry, its a nice and cheap blackberry i used in very hard working conditions and i have it for a year or so, its very durable. had nice functions, wi-fi, and work international phone and battery was in really good shape but the charger and back casing could be better would have been 5 stars on another note phone works with tmobile 4g lte with the correct apn settings i was so excited to recieve my 32gb black iphone 4s! it was delivered within 2 days which made me extremely happy as well. however when i opened the box i found a white iphone. not a big deal. i switched the phone over with ease and everything was perfect. until i realized it wasnt a 4s either. i already had a white iphone 4, why would i want another one??? i am so dissapointed. i called amazon and they recommended i just get a refund. now i have to send back the phone i was so excited to get, and order another phone, probably from ebay. cool. this will be the last time i order from amazon for a while. this phone doesn\\'t stay charged and when the battery gets low it will not send text without notification the text didn\\'t send. has cause major headaches!! sorry i got rid of my other phone, it worked much better than this one. drops calls no issues, phone performs well. love it despite giving the lg g4 3 stars, i did find it to be a mostly enjoyable experience. here is a breakdown:pros:+1080p images on the screen look excellent+the speaker on the phone is actually decent+still uses the microusb standard+the lock button is position on the back of the device. this is great because your hand naturally rests on the back and makes a quick and easy unlock+the camera is top notch! 16mp is pretty great on a phone and you will not be disappointed.+the leather backing is really nice to hold and gives a moderate amount of grip. most days i go without a case because i love the leather.+ability to change the battery and add a microsd card! i missed the ability to upgrade my storage from when i had a galaxy s5.cons-the backing pops off every time i remove a case from my phone and i am afraid it will break every time-the lg ui is pretty restrictive by android standards, though i was pleased to see marshmallow 6.0 out of the box.-the battery is pretty bad. this is one of the biggest reasons i gave the lg g4 a 3 star rating, and why i ultimately got rid of it.-sometimes apps bug or crash. i am sure this is just a software issue as the g4 has pretty good specs besides.-the screen is very dark. this was also a big concern for me because in the summer time here in alaska, we have sunlight most of the day and damn it\\'s bright!overall:the lg g4 was an excellent phone besides the lacking battery life and low brightness screen. for $300 it is a great buy and it even comes unlocked! has been a good buy, since the phone is lightweight, inexpensive and with the necessary functions to capitalize, delivery was on time, no problem with the product arrived in good condition, flawless, thanks works great!!!! i would recommend this company to anybody for purchases they make! i have no problems at all with this phone! worked: ram increase, faster downloads i already had an iphone 5c but it only had 8gb of storage. i needed much more. i ordered this phone, it came earlier than expected. it was fully functional and had no problems. it also looks brand new. i\\'ve owned this now for a few months and everything is working fine. it offers plenty of storage. it was a good deal for the price. great i wanted this phone for a long time because i thought it was cute.horrible phone. the touch screen is, for lack of a better word, wonky. very unresponsive. great phone!!!!! its definitely a keeper i bought this item in december and shipping was fast. never experienced any problems with the phone up to now its been great! thumbs up! good product i\\'m loving it! fantastic phone! it wish it had nfc so i could do google pay or set up a few commands. it doesn\\'t bother me much although it is slightly counter intuitive that the fingerprint sensor doesn\\'t double as a home button.the phone is fast. it is super responsive. it takes a 128gb sd card! i love it! very good the phone arrived very quickly, and it works really well with my t-mobile network, it was an effortless transition from an iphone. you get that you pay awesome if you\\'re getting this phone to use your provider\\'s wifi calling - don\\'t! it will not work. for tmobile subscribers this is critical since they often have poor reception in certain areas. of course you can download 3rd party wifi calling apps, but you wont be able to make/receive calls using your own phone number. if you don\\'t need wifi calling - then it is a fine deal. excellent phone!!! i\\'m actually considering purchasing another on of these phones. perfect size, not to big. screen is clear. excellent cover and screen protector comes with the phone. 32 gb of memory i have over 2500 songs saved on this phone. great phone for a good price, i was surprise when i reviced the phone its big and it works greats. love it, love it phone is very good, i use skype all the time without any issue. excellent relation between price and quality. totally recommend it! have my nokia e7-00 for two weeks now...and loving every moment of it...in the beginning i couldn\\'t access ovi store or set up emails but after i emailed nokia , those features started working the next day. five stars for the keyboard..easy to text and very durable..just open it from the side edges and youre fine...great security features overall best phone i\\'ve had to date. excelente excelente great! i\\'ve owned htc phones before so i knew what to expect and they didn\\'t disappoint. i especially.love how high the volume is when watching videos or listening to music. graphics are clear too. camera pictures are clean and crisp. stores lots of movies. awesome! i returned it no problem with it splendid product i upgraded to the iphone 6 when it came out (i needed to test a few apps on the larger screen) and then last year i thought, \"if i get the plus, i can have an even better reading/watching experience\". after 6 months, i\\'m ditching my 6s+ and i\\'m loving this phone! it\\'s so small and light it almost feels like a toy, and i don\\'t need a case to keep from dropping it. i got as unlocked phone. just nice. thanks in summary the nokia e71 is a high end voice/video/messaging communication device it is not to be confused with a web viewing or gaming device.for some odd reason nokia phones have never been that popular in the usa in comparison to europe and australasia. this model the e71-2 is made in finland and is the unlocked (non carrier specific) us model version and has gsm/egsm (grps edge) quad band 850/900/1800/1900 mhz and uses 850/1900 mhz for utms/wcdma (high speed data packet access hsdpa aka 3g)[...]. so what you ask? basically, with the us model if you travel overseas don\\'t expect to receive umts (3g) service.the nokia e71 is best called a high end business smartphone....kind of like those high-end german cars it has more bells and whistles than any other smartphone on the market and just like those high-end german cars (designed by engineers for engineers!) you will need to read the manual and play around with all of the buttons to work out all the features it has to offer. the nokia uses the symbian (competitor to android and iphone) operating system and has a relatively large number of applications that will run on the phone. all of the currently popular applications are available for the phone skype, facebook, youtube etc. many of the apps can be directly downloaded from nokia\\'s \"ovi store\" using the app directly from the phone.the phone has a built in fm radio that works great, but you will need the headset to be plugged in (it acts as the antenna), but once plugged in you can use the loudspeaker. the audio is very good and plenty loud when using it with all the audio applications. the phone has a built in gps receiver and now has free ovi maps (global set...you will need a large memory card if try and download them all) available from nokai for download. the gps works great and has a large voice set available also, my daughter loves the english surfer dude speaker. phone has infrared, bluetooth and wifi connectivity built in.the wifi works well and is a great feature at home or on the road. i can web surf and download podcasts (it has a podcast subscription app). the phone has an internet radio application that is also a great feature...you can listen to many us and intentional based internet radio stations like the bbc for free.i personally prefer to have a keyboard with my phones rather than a touch screen and like the nokia for this reason, it is odd that i find it easier to type with the e71 keyboard than my work issued blackberry. the screen is about the same size as the blackberry screen, but nokia have (in my opinion) could have worked better on using the real estate and particularly with the font and icon size on the home page. if you have bad eyesight you may find the e71 very hard to use without a magnifying glass.the good:1: high end unlocked smartphone for less that $230!!!! (not locked to a carrier or plan)2: unlocked phone has many phone carrier defeating applications. voip/sip and wifi3: phone supports cell/phone calls, video camera calls (has both forward facing and rear facing camera), internet (voip/sip) calls in native application, skype, fring calls...4: applications galore included.5: ovi store applications and gps maps for free.6: phone is lightweight.7: battery life is great and is user replaceable.8: phone will multi-task without any issues, listen to the radio, web surf and download all at the same time.the bad:1: phone almost requires a degree to operate.2: too many menu options and levels to achieve tasks.the ugly:1: text size and phone icons (3g, signal/battery bars) are miniscle.2: phone requires a phd to totally master.3: pc based ovi/pc suite sync application is slooooooooooooooooow.i\\'m using the phone with a $6.99 for 90 days t-mobile prepaid sim card and have setup a voip/sip account along with google voice for voice mail and free wifi internet calling. life is good. very odd but my teenage daughter would rather have my e71 than an iphone.overall the e71 is a great communication device with many great features included for the price. if you are looking for a cheaper phone then have a look at the nokia e63 as an option, it does not have a gps receiver, forward video camera or external volume controls. but is a tougher phone with all the other attributes of the e71 above. for about $159 you can find a new unlocked with us warranty supported e63. as advertised received incorrect case with phone. phone os will not be updated to android 5, even though the phone was released in december 2014. phone constantly resets to factory setting whenever you power off phone, worst phone every owned. unable to received email and or messages at time. phone constantly freezes when using. after owning this phone for 90 days i can honestly say this is the worst smartphone i have ever used. the battery life is horrible! it will go from 100 to 45 in just 30 minutes on standby. it will even lose charge and die if you use it while charging. the camera is so-so. it only comes with a handful of tricks. i like that blu was doing something different with wp but i still have not received windows 10 mobile yet. i understand the phone is cheap but please just save your money for a mid-range galaxy. i haven\\'t received anything. frankly, the calling to get reimbursed or see why the phone hasn\\'t arrived is not worth my time. bought this for my husband. he does love it, however it drains his phone too much and too fast. great buy! delivered on time. product received as described. very good phone!!! the order bill its no present whit my cell phone? i need the bill for complete the order. its the one yes it works great so far so good phone works great no problems. only thing is that i didnt know you had to switch out to a mini sim card which was no problem getting one though very good for this price nice, beautyfull even with the sim card al the features, such as receiving pictures are not available and attaching pictures to facebook etc. not a very user friendly phone. all the apps act differently. i would not by an out of network phone again. i will stick to what my provider actually offers even if its limited as at least all the features work the way they are supposed to. it very good i am working with it in egypt on all the networks and it with 50 % of the price just to clarify, since at the time i\\'m writing the review, the thumbnail icon is different from the product picture on the page: this product is for a hard shell case for the lg optimus s ls670, it\\'s white with a black spiral pattern.it\\'s a hard material and snaps in place. it\\'s good protection while it lasts, but one of the times my phone fell, it broke part of the case that is needed to fasten the two sides together. it also seems to have made my phone run warmer than it would normally.however, for the price and considering the phone is now quite outdated, it\\'s not bad. awesome phone since i\\'ve been using this phone which is about a month, i have never had amy major issues with it . it has a nice audio, resolution, fast sensitivity to touch, camera both front and back. the only minor faults i have with it is its lack of multitasking and not adjust to light background for the camera. except for that, it is really nice and durable because lord knows how many times i\\'ve dropped this phone in over a month and it still works adequately. i would highly recommend this phone to any buyer i would not buy a blu phone again. this phone lasted a little over a year before the battery stopped working properly. i would have paid for a replacement battery but blu customer service said that the company does not offer replacement batteries and the third-party vendors and web sites that they referred me to did not have batteries in stock for this model and did not foresee getting them in stock in the future. a few web sites claim to have compatible batteries but we do not know yet if they will work in this phone. i wanted a basic phone, and this phone filled that purpose for a year (though the camera on the phone was definitely sub-standard). but i do not buy many electronics and i do not want the few that i do buy to turn into garbage in just a little over a year\\'s time. great price and it does everything i need it to do! it didn\\'t come with a american charger and the reception is awful.. the only way i can download is on wifi, without wifi its useless. check and make sure youre not buying a international version because they aren\\'t nor do they work the same because the international system runs on true 4g> in america we use 4g lte google it theres a difference that\\'s why it dosent work properly. i hate to send it back because is a beautiful phone but there\\'s nothing i can do with it i\\'m giving 2 stars because i actually like the phone itself. bought this to hold my work id and metrocard so i wouldnt have to carry anything else on my daily commute. they both fit perfectly inside even with the mirror insert. rfid card access still works through this case, although the case has to come pretty close to the reader to be registered. bought a new phone (not used or refurbished). beautiful phone. looks sleek and modern. came with a free case and screen protector. powered off with no problem. clean layout, easy navigation. i was in love with this phone. however, after a few days, the blue screen of death appeared and the phone would not shut off. after taking out and re-inserting the battery, the phone started to work as normal. a few more days later, i got another blue screen of death. this time, the phone powered itself down and could not be turned on again. i had to return it.i really, really wanted to love this phone. it\\'s affordable and looks beautiful. i wonder if i got a lemon. i\\'m debating on whether or not to give it another try and purchase another one. maybe second time is a charm? so bad this phone was refurbished but still worked perfectly! there were a few noticeable scratches and scuffs on the back of the phone, but nothing a good case couldnt take away. nothing was wrong with the phone and was exactly what i was expecting for $150. a very good deal indeed great mobile phone! i like this phone. it is rugged, feels great in your hands, is smaller than most phones with equivalent cases to the s5 active\\'s built in form, and has about as good a battery as the s4. also, seems pretty fast and handles fast internet speeds well. (got up to the max 6 mbs/s of my home wifi with a particularly decent download source a few times, and phone still handled internet browsing, watching youtube, etc., without issue) i did not like the phone at all. i bought it less than a month and i can not hear the person who is calling me. very disappointed!!! not bad at all thanks thata great the phone is great, good size, internationally ready and it works great for my christmas present there seems to be a lot of functions on the watch. but the manual is vague at best.if your going to put in only name and # for the phone, i recommend you put it to the sim card. twice now, we lost data that was saved to the watch, not sure why. it is supposed to have voice command capability, but could not get it to recognize any command.if you turn on voice for phone numbers to be audible, it only speaks in chinese, no matter what language is selected.the plus side, calls a crisp and clear on the receiving end, and the speaker option to the watch is hard to hear. the mp 3 player is good with the included ear buds(only way mp3\\'s can be played). the stylus is neatly tucked in the band, and does not slip out.the watch will accept a 16gb micro sd card. it keeps time well and can choose time as a screen saver, and then just tap the screen for it to display. i actually bought this for my wife, so she could have an easily accessible phone that was easy to use and out of the way. and can be used quickly in an emergency. the battery life is good, and it comes with a spare battery. it is a good price when you consider you get blue tooth ear phone and charging cable, ear buds, two batteries, charging unit for phone and blue tooth( can only charge one at a time.) i have never reviewed a product before but with the blue studio 5.5 see it worked great for a couple of months and then it just quit it won\\'t connect to wierdly right after the return policy went up.... dont buy phone was probably fine, but would not work on verizon. seller gladly refunded the money. i brought my s5 about a week ago and didn\\'t purchase the insurance. i made sure to get a protective case to avoid any possible damage to my phone. i chose the purple and grey option and although the case is big the muted purple doesn\\'t look bad. i love it. muy bueno i liked the look of this cell, it\\'s not as big as the new pixel or iphone though, but it\\'s not tiny either. i was looking for an unlocked cell that was under $100 and at first glance the rca m1 seemed to fit, but out of the box it would not connect to our home wifi. or it would say that my wifi was \"out of range\", even when i was standing over my router and modem. after going through almost all of the comments and q&a\\'s i found that it has an issue with the internal antenna and some have had to return their phone for a replacement. i contacted the seller and got a somewhat by the numbers response... did i enter my password in right, have i contacted my service provider... that kind of thing. at this point i am using cricket\\'s unlimited internet for all my needs. if i had went with a smaller data plan or with another carrier that did not offer unlimited data i also would have returned this phone for a refund. the only reason i give it 3 stars \\'it\\'s okay\\' rating is because of the work around i was able to get with the cricket internet and because i\\'m not returning the cell. it will work until i can afford a better phone. if you plan on buying this cell you should also know that the battery life is not that great about 5 to 7 hours with light usage. ie, skype, youtube, checking email and some txting. if using for music it\\'s a little better. you get what you pay for, i guess. other than that it functions like any other smart phone. this phone is by far the absolute worst phone i have ever had- and i am not a picky person when it comes to phones. i tried multiple times to calibrate the touch screen, but it was never correct. it was absolutely impossible to dial a number using the touch screen because when i would hit a number another would be entered (sometimes i would type \"8\" and \"2\" would appear\"). i found myself in tears from the simple task of trying to call my grandmother. the battery life was what caused me to get another phone... it lasted 2 hours on a good day. many times i was stranded on the side of the road and forced to walk through snow, sleet, and hail to reach my destination because my phone could not remain on long enough to perform it\\'s basic function- call for help. the picture quality was terrible. i have a dog with white fur and black spots. the pictures are so blurry that my dog appears as a gray blob with a tail. oftentimes the screens would simple freeze and i would have to remove the battery in order to use the phone. this would usually cause me to launch the phone across the room due to frustration, which proves to be quite humiliating while in class, meetings, or other professional settings. also, sometimes i would simply set the phone down and the battery would pop out! i literally could not believe what was happening. i had to put the battery back in the phone and then power on the device. 15 seconds of my life... gone! once i turned the phone on to find all of my preferences (background, password, text themes, etc) were replaced. i still can\\'t explain that one. i did not bother to reset my preferences- it was not worth the hassle. instead i smashed the thing to smithereens and invested in a droid. it was a cheap phone and barely served as a suitable replacement for the 3 months that i could bear to use the thing. i lost a lot of sleep, hair, and bodily fluids over this phone and would not wish it on my worst enemy. the phone is good i love my phone but it took some time learning how to use it but now i can\\'t live without it. thanks for delivering the phone in good condition and fast delivery. this phone is fake we can not even use it for one week . i will nenever again buy this product this phone stop working in 2 days! love this phone. bought it for my kids to take on vacation out of the country and it works very very well! i can\\'t get the thing to sync with my phone. i even watched several youtube videos on how to do it and still can\\'t figure it out. can\\'t find the sound to turn it down or off. can\\'t pull up the apps section most of the time. sending it back. don\\'t waste your money! ___i have owned every iphone since the 3g model. every year for 7 years i have upgraded. in my household is a slew of apple products from ipad’s, macbook’s to iphones. my household now has 3 new iphone 7 models. but i am also a bigtime android owner with several high end android phones and tablets from various manufactures. the thing is, my family loves high end tech and appreciates quality regardless of brand, make or model.i follow the mobile tech world religiously and stay abreast of all new technologies and products from all companies, big and small. i watched the keynote on september 7th live and listened to apple pitch the iphone 7. i pre-ordered the 7 at 3am est on the 9th so i could have it in my hands on the 16th.but then i came to a realization about the 7 and 7 plus that struck a chord with me. all the new tech on the 7 is not new at all, in fact has been on several phones in some cases since 2011. i also realized that the tech inside the 7 only matches mid-range android versions. if you take the apple logo off the back and re-brand this under android, it would not be a $770-$970 device but a $350-$550 device given the hardware and features it has. in fact, apples net cost on the 256gb 7 plus is only $226 yet retails for $970. this is disturbing to me, not just the 403% profit margin, but the whole effort into making an average iphone for today’s standards. apple use to be a leading-edge company with innovations that took the industry by storm. today, in 2016, apple no longer excites me. sure the integration between software and hardware is not matched by any tech company today but the gap is rapidly bridging. at such a premium price, i think after this version, considering there is nothing innovative about it and retails for double what other companies offer, has me moving away from apple in 2017. i don’t know about you, but the old saying goes the bigger you are the harder you fall. bye bye apple, time for a divorce.___update 9/22/2016: in response to criticism about my review:___apple certainly raised the bar on smartphones and has kept that bar up. my expectations are high for the iphone and as such when they are not met, as with the iphone 7/7 plus, my letdown is all that much harder. the iphone 7/7 plus are great phones do doubt, but do i think they are $970 great? certainly not. apple (could have) done so much better with the iphone 7 and didn\\'t. that is my letdown.when it comes to raw processing power apple wins in controlled and application tests. but in 2016/17 nearly all phones are fast enough, heck even the iphone 5s of 4 years ago is fast enough, but today, shaving milliseconds off app switching times or load times goes beyond the human brains capacity to keep up. it\\'s not about pure brawns, ecosystems, cultures, or social image, it\\'s about value and making life\\'s tasks easier.apples multi-million dollar 12 step polishing process to get the jet black phone to shine is not nearly as important as making it available at affordable prices and offering cutting edge features that make my whole reason for existing plausible.if i walked into my honda dealer and saw the new 2017 accord had a price tag of $110,000 i would walk out immediately, it\\'s about value. even if the accord blew the doors off its competition i still walk because its value is lost.truth of the matter is even india\\'s $4 phone gets the job done, and that\\'s a fact.lets examine the iphone 7/7 plus components.cpu:the a10 fusion chip in the apple 7’s is manufactured by tsmc, (samsung made the a9 chips in the 6s). it is a quad-core 16nm big.little soc running at 2.34ghz tops, 1.3ghz nominal with 3gb of lpddr4 ram, (2gb on the 4.7- inch version). similar chips and even more powerful quad-core, hexi-core and even octa-core chips run in various far less expensive phones using 4gb to 6gb of lpddr4 ram running in dual channel mode. the one thing apple does do extremely well is manage its ram which is all software based. the linux driven android software has not got there yet. yes, this is an advantage apple currently holds over the competition but one that is vastly slipping away.lcd:the lcd panel is also on level with submarket phones. the lpips 1080 panel is rated at 401p, 1300:1 contrast, (1400:1 on the 4.7 inch), 625nits and p3 cinematic color gamut at 125%. let’s examine this. with the exception of the p3 color gamut, every $200 and above phone has this or better. i can list a slew of phones all under $300 that have lpips, (or even better oled), 1080 fhd, 1500:1 to infinite contrast ratio, 500-700nits and srgb color gamut at 100%. the neo-lpips panel supplied on huawei products is nearly as excellent as the s-amoleds produced by samsung and supplied on phones starting at $150. apple has been in talks with samsung about supplying s-amoled panels for the iphone for 3 years, i believe the iphone 8 will receive this panel next year. the cinematic p3 rating and higher brightness output (nit) was given to the iphone 7’s to help make the photos pop on-screen better.camera:the bokeh effects of the dual camera system on the 7 plus can easily be duplicated in post with software. i won’t argue and say the camera implementation on the iphone 7’s is not excellent, sure it is. but the leica dual camera system on the p9 and honor 8 are just as good and offered on devices that match or surpass other technical features and cost half as much. the camera system on the s7 is excellent too. lg has excellent implementations on the older g4, g5 and new v20. the lg g4 that can be had for $150, has a 2.1ghz hexi-core cpu, 3gb ram, 5.5-ich qhd screen, 32gb on board memory, 128gb sd slot, and a 16mp camera that shoots in raw and even by today’s standards is excellent shooter.software:with ios 10 we can now delete stock apple apps. this is apples way of saying they understand their app versions suck and no one uses them or want them. we can replace them with much better 3rd party versions that also happen to have equally good android versions. in the 30 days ios 10 has been on the iphone 7, (9/16 to 10/12), it has had two major updates, v10.0.1 and v10.0.2. let’s not forget the epic failure of the lightening headphones, gallery app and extensions crashing. this is a bug fix every two weeks. also in the 30 days i have owned my iphone 7 i have had to perform two hard resets for apple apps locking and seizing up, one was safari the other imessages. at one point i had to get apple support on the phone. in 2016/2017 android v7.01 (and 6.0.1) are just as stable and efficient and maybe even more so, but my point is there is no advantage one over the other, at this stage it is simply a matter of personal preferences. we can’t argue that ios is superior to android because surely is not. with almost all apps being cross-platform functional communications between ios and android is now transparent and we can fully immerse in both worlds without any effects.samsung:i have given the same review about samsung products. samsung is by no means the messiah of android. their products are matched or outdone with less expensive variants as well. samsung will have a very difficult time recovering from their $1b fiasco this year. when a company starts selling of its stock interest and shares on partner companies and liquidating core assets you know they are in trouble.storage:the reason apple does not offer external sd storage is twofold. one, the sd license is held by microsoft and apple would have to pay royalties to microsoft in order to use it. apple will never pay royalties to any company – royalties are paid to apple not the other way around. two, apple would lose control over file sharing.apple trivia - did you know:did you know the iphone has many samsung components? samsung has made the cpu/gpu for several generations of iphones. this year with the 7 samsung supplies the ram chips and rom chips. samsung is rumored to supply its s-amoled screens next year for the iphone 8.did you know google pays apple $100 million/year to have google set as the default search for safari? google also pays apple a percentage for every click too.did you know google invests more money and r&d for its ios apps over its own android counterparts? apps like hangouts, google maps, chrome, google now etc., get updates and new releases before its own native android versions.did you know that amazon hosts the icloud storage for apple? amazon is the largest cloud host in the world providing several companies with its aws servers. apple pays amazon hundreds of millions of dollars every year for its cloud servers.did you know apple refused to pay corning its royalties to use the gorilla glass name so calls its glass ‘ionized strengthened’ even though it is corning gorilla glass version 4.did you know the iphone 6/6s also has water resistant features? apple never published or made public this feature for liability reasons but the 6/6s has resins and glues inside to protect vital components from water damage. if you have ever dropped your 6/6s in water usually within a couple hours its up and running at 100%.___thank you for reading___ the only thing is that i do not read chinesse. so the navigator and other stuff are in chinesse . and i can not understand them. but by the phone is great. only the software programming shuld be alllllll in english. since it is for an american user. this lg g3 is fast and the screen is beautiful!i will reconfirm that the 4g will not work in the us on cricket wireless (at&t network). but the 3g connection is plenty fast enough for my needs and i wanted a 1440p screen for under $300 that was also unlocked.having both a user replaceable battery and expandable storage is excellent for users who would like to keep there phone for longer than a year.battery life is good easily lasting throughout the day with average use.software updates could be more frequent, this phone is still on android 5.0. rumor has it that 6.0 will be released to the g3 but we\\'ll have to wait and see.the lg software overlay is very functional and doesn\\'t detract from the experience whatsoever.the camera takes excellent photos and is extremely fast to focus. the camera is beyond what most will ever need in a smartphone,you can even use this phone as a remote control but this feature isn\\'t the greatest due to the poor range.i think this is still the only phone available with a 1440p screen in this price range and the extra gb of ram on the international version is appreciated. i recommend buying a glass screen cover to protect the beautiful screen. as a first time iphone owner i can\\'t say why this phone is better than another. but i will thus far, i am impressed with my new [to me but used] iphone 4s. pictures are great, seems to be a decent speed for running applications. even the ios7 seems to work good. the only drawback, like most phones, especially used, is the battery life. but overall i enjoy my verizon wireless apple iphone 4s. excelente first of all the phone was not an iphone 3gs , it is an iphone 3g instead.#2 i could not activate it for some reason by connecting it with itunes , i\\'ve tried dozens of time unsuccessfullydon\\'t trust this buyer , all they care about is getting customers money i love my cell phone, and i think it was the best deal i ever had in buying a phone. just what i wanted. fantastic i am disappointed as this phone is less than a month old and it hangs quite often. i have bought so many products in the last two months in amazon and this is the most disappointing one. the phone is just awesome, it is the best phone in the world you will never find better than this, only the problem was too late shipping and very expensive. its not one of the affordable price. i am loving this phone and all the wonderful features. fabulous!!!!! many games caused the phone to halt, and then after 1 month new bugs started to pop up.the touch screen is not responding anymore, phone is turned on only if connected to the chargerhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b004n861mg/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title i like my new watch. i can tell time, make and take phone calls, listen to my rhapsody music that i download away from home. loving it so far, my only problem i listen to music all the time with a bluetooth head set, the battery is down to about 15% after about 6 hours of continuous listening. i wish the battery would last longer, but no worries it still like my new watch.update: 11-1-15play store, google keep, gmail, ms one note, wow!update 12-23-15received my soundbot sb250 and my bluetooth keyboard\\xa0blue wind

ultimately good, only bad fact is .that it didnt come with a case and after 4 days of use the white began chipping. but it works well, good camera for the price and flash. the android os works fast and allows for the download of all the apps desired with google play thanks! excellent as someone who just wants a good *small phone*, for making phone calls, i found myself buying this one because it was literally the only small phone i could find (the phone i replaced was a bar phone the size of a chicklets box). every other option available now is either a smart phone or cheap flip-phone garbage.so i chose this phone entirely for its size, not because it\\'s a smart phone (keyboard way too small to type on), and i was very pleasantly surprised at the call quality on the handset and when using bluetooth. i *do* recommend this phone if you just want something small for making calls, but don\\'t get your hopes up.having said that, you get what you pay for:- the pictures provided by the manufacturer are *very* misleading, showing a standard android launcher screen, when in fact this phone has a cheap, custom ux that tries and fails to look like ios.- for no discernible reason, this custom ui doesn\\'t use android standards — for example… - there is no apps tray, and instead all your apps are on your homescreen whether you like it or not - it has a recent apps button, but it\\'s inexplicably used for settings instead - recent apps is instead found only by holding down the home button- the paltry user guide has *no* instructions of any kind about this nonsense custom ui, so you\\'re completely on your own for figuring out stuff like how to reach recent apps, so good luck figuring out how to add widgets or rearrange the home screens (tap and hold on empty spot of launcher)- instead of using the perfectly fine android contacts app, there\\'s a custom contacts app that leaves a lot to be desired- you can\\'t edit or delete contacts stored on your sim card (but you can add new sim contacts) - (you\\'ll have to download \"sim contacts\" by penumbraapps from play store - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.penumbra.apps.sim_contacts_manager- the maximum volume on the handset isn\\'t loud enough- the maximum volume on the speakerphone *really, really* isn\\'t loud enough- you can\\'t change lock screen background to pic — you\\'re stuck with what they give you- because of screen size, keyboard is nearly impossible to type on - download \"touchpal,\" which is a) the best keyboard for android anyway, b) allows you to resize it (i can type on this one)- status bar shows mobile & wifi signal strength, but *doesn\\'t show bluetooth status* (again, silly custom ui) - however, there is a power control widget you can put on the home screen for that- the battery monitor is wildly inaccurate- if you keep your phone numbers on your sim, the direct dial widget thinks *every* phone number is a mobile phone, and you can\\'t change it- the accelerometer is sketchy — when pulling phone down from face during call, screen comes on only about 1/10th of the time - worse, power button doesn\\'t start up the screen during calls about 60% of the time eitherif anyone else made decent small feature phones anymore, i probably wouldn\\'t have even looked at this one. but if you want a small phone with decent call quality, you\\'re pretty much stuck with this. great phone for the price, nice camera and it runs smooth (with only 1 gb ram) it is good!! nice phone, as expected. the screen on this phone does not stay lit for very long, i have to keep hitting the button to get it to light up again. its a pain when you are trying to do something. phone came within 5 days with case included, along with the original box and samsung charger as well as headphones. buy buy buy! reall love this phone but the battery is terrible! and for some reason as others have said the wifi and cell radio turn off on their own for no apparent reason. this really sucks as everything else about this phone is fantastic. changing to 1 star because now the mic stopped working and no one can hear me. i am not the owner of it but i suspect everything is good. it was a gift for a lost soul.delivery was as stated and on time as promised.thank you guys so much and have a blessed 2015.arnold collins excellent smartphone parese good i have to use for product quality meet the expected standard, i was very happy with the purchase. the phone was shipped overseas with an intention of shipping it back if it does not work as expected. fortunately enough it worked as advertised. both ends happy everyone happy. i just wish the phones speaker was louder. otherwise great product for the money. works fantastic. thank you! i believe i was purchasing a new - not refurbhished item. however, the phone has been problematic since it was activated. after a few months of use, it began to power itself down automatically after 5 to 20 minutes of use. it also didn\\'t hold a charge for very long. i took it to a recommended repair shop and the technician suggested that the battery could be bad. upon opening the phone to change the battery, he discovered a somewhat bloated battery - indicating that it had probably been wet at one time. (i can attest that the phone has never been dunked!) he also said that \"stickers\" inside the case indicate that the phone was a refurbished one. i had never had it serviced before and as said, i thought i was buying a new phone. when i ordered, there was no indication to say it was not anything but new. upon notifying the seller that i received a used/refurbished rather than a new phone, i received a canned reply that basically said i had 30 days from purchase to return the phone - a totally unsatisfactory answer. however, for $65 (plus tax) spent on a new battery, the phone now works well. i certainly would not buy from this dishonest provider again. nice phone perfect for my wife on puretalk program this thing is junk. you can\\'t open the app you have to install on phone. i absolutely love this smart phone! bought an iphone 4s and ended up returning it. the android os is way better than ios, amazing apps! the phone quality is, too. the only weakness in the box is the manual. a blurry copy in small print, not helpful in anyway for a user standpoint. but as far as the phone goes, i am glad i made the right choice. i order a samsung galaxy s3. it was supposed to be cdma verizon and gsm unlocked but its not. its locked to verizon and i can\\'t get it activated to straight talk like i want. i will never order from this company again. the phone gas veena taken apart and has scratches on the back side of the screen. it is cracked in 3 places. it locks by itself and when i push unlock button it does nothing most of the time. i spent $150 on a piece of crap phone. the description said it was in great condition. i just want my money back or a better phone that is actually unlocked. i noticed the moto g plus in the prime days advertising. the octa core processor captivated me. after researching the processor it is true that there is no specific programs for 8 cores, the snap dragon processor uses one quad core for low power programs and one for high power programs. low power uses such as phone calls are routed through one quad core and gaming is routed through a high power core. the phone calls are clear and the games play well. i find the camera exceptionally capable and the hd features clear. i have not tried out all of the features, but there are so many. so far so good. fantastic price point for the high quality. i bought this for my son and he loves his phone. i may even buy me one. it doesn\\'t come with the magnetic charging chip excelent all i m happy very thanks please send me info for more i hope will be you customer again soon highly recommend. works great. the reception on this phone is terrible. mt previous phone was an iphone 5s which had much better reception. something is wrong with phone. i\\'m on verizon. in places where my 5s got consistently good reception this phone is lucky to get one dot. same plastic case on both phones. looks and work beautifully. recommend to purchase from this vendor this phone is rly nice, i got a pink and a yellow 8xl for my parents. set them both up and they were very fast and the screen way way better than i thought it wld be. they are running kk but i clda swore it was suppose to update to lp outa the box??? either way it dont matter bc they are coming from an og atrix and a gnex :/ these phones are tremendous upgrades! $79 bucks on preorder cant be beat. there is some crutch on the front of the phone . but its work good and i will keep it it\\'s says dual sim but black color is not.. delivered on time and very durable haven\\'t had a problem love this phone. been using for a month now smooth run . this product is a scam. it is announced as \"us version\" but it is an international version. great price and great phone excelente the cell phone is \"locked\".the description is wrong! i contacted samsung, and they asked me to contact the service provider to get \"network control key\" . i contacted t-mobil. they said i don\\'t have an account with them, because i have at&t sim card.i go back and forth so many times then found out that samsung did not put out that description. the only one put out the description is the seller which is amazon. i called amazon to have this error corrected. i bought it and practically the same week they change the price, a lower off course beware. these are lemons - something is wrong with a lot of the phone these people sell. they are not new, no matter what it says. they are refurbs. i bought one from them, and wanted to return it since it had issues - they were willing to take it back. only issue is i didn\\'t have a back up phone, so i got lazy and didn\\'t send it in time. pro - great return policy, if the phone isn\\'t working right you can and should return it. don\\'t get lazy like me.the phone had stripes across the screen within a few days. i ordered a new glass screen for the phone - another $80 blown. it works perfectly now. i mean i got a phone, just don\\'t think it was worth the money they charged. this phone does not work properly with at&t service. i spent over an hour on the phone with att trying to get it to work right and it just doesn\\'t. wont even send and receive texts dependably. then after 2 weeks the screen cracked. the phone looks good, but its junk. don\\'t waste your money. after some issues, not by the seller, the item was as described. it\\'s perfect! and they gave me a car charger and two phones cases for the mishap. thank you! i bought the cell phone for my sister and she saids is perfect. you will not get a 1 yr apple warranty with this purchase. my phone stopped working in 6 months with no damage to it. i contacted apple and was told it was already replaced. i contacted the seller for refund and he just closed my request. horrible experience. will never buy from this seller. nice phone,4g conection really an excellent telephone .excellent prize fully satisfied with this product. even other people seem to like it. brought it to at&t for a sim card and the technician liked it was well. hopefully some day they can make a removable battery so i can replace on-the-fly with no need for a charger. battery life is sufficient for typical usage. love love my phone! it\\'s a great phone love it will recommend buying it for yourself of a friend or a relative they will love it great product, inexpensive price! great size for gaming, streaming and skype. thanks. i really like the phone but two days after i got it, the bluetooth feature would pair with the phone but the phone won\\'t allow me to make or receive calls using bluetooth. very unhappy with that! no problems and great durability for a flip phone with a front screen. still have mine incase my smartphone breaks. the phone lasted a long time, my problem was more so with the inability to set alarms and when you set to-do items on your calendar and set an alarm to go off no sound went off to warn you. we are still getting used to our phones but i must admit they are more than i imagined. works great with a few pain in the butt drawbacks. this phone really struggles with apps. it even buffers downloaded music. great for the price but i would recommend another brand. working excelent on argentina carriers, the phone is a little heavy but it is worth it. great phone. though, its hard to get accessories for it (i know its not one of the newer phones out). no one here seems to carry htc stuff (at a decent price anyway). it is different from my old android phone!!! some things are good changes, a few things i miss!! but i love it and am still learning new things!!! hello i have the equipment with micro sim movistar vzla i say things in favor and things against, good: the team size is perfect super comfortable, the camera is very good compared to other computers high-end quality audio and video is excellent the team always fast and when you have no overloaded memory, have not had any failure so far, against only has 4gb very little memory, lock and volume buttons are on the back making it super uncomfortable for me, inicio buttons are built into the screen i think that takes away space, having space below the screen where is the lg logo ... good phone for the price. i use it in europe and west africa. depending on the provider the net is slow in general.if you leave on the internet forget about this phone. poor sound was nothing like i thought it would be!!!! trash phone is not international version or world phone and i hate every time i power up or go to certain features it says at&t which i cant stand i have t-mobile service they just unlocked an at&t phone. i love this phone..i need to get used to all the stuff on it..went from a flip phone to this. love the photos..thanks i love it,excellent phone phone is ok. only problem is home button malfunction. i have to press extra hard for it to work. seller 100% recommended. he complied with everything. !!! excellent, now i`m learning to use that. thanks the phone is not unlocked, locked with at&t and will not work with any other service provider. very disappointed. i was looking for an at&t compatible phone. this is advertised as an unlocked gsm phone (which is compatible), but i received a verizon phone, which is cdma. it \"works\", but a lot of the functionality does not work, it has low bars of service, and is on an \" h\" network rather than 4g lte. the phone i received even had the name verizon written across it, which is not as advertised. everything was good with this purchase this is a good product considering its cost. not to be used as a full smart phone due to its limited camera definition and functions, but a good temporary replacement or to be used by someone not looking for a highly technified or sophisticated device. love it nice one okay good this phone is great!! excellente each used iphone on amazon will be different. hard to tell which one you will get , in terms of batter life and wear and tear. good luck! i purchase this item to sent to jamaica and phone was not unlock properly.have to pay $4500 ja dollar to unlock phone properly. i specifically bought this version of the galaxy (rather than the newer s6) because it claimed to be waterproof. it wasn\\'t. accidentally dropped it into some water (with all of the ports sealed and the back case on), and now it is dead. i tried to dry it out, but it is still dead. of course the warranty doesn\\'t cover water damage... even though they market the phone as being protected against just this scenario. i was a loyal samsung customer, but this is absolutely the last samsung i will ever buy. i have also become that person who rails against samsung at every opportunity. i will probably get some tee shirts made at the local airbrushing place at the mall with \"samsung lies\" printed across them, with a sad, dead, phone, slowly leaking water in the background. i will insist that all members of my family wear these shirts whenever they are in public. the kids will probably be happy with this arrangement, since they wanted iphones anyway. maybe i\\'ll hang a bedsheet with \"don\\'t believe samsung!\" hastily scrawled on it with dripping shoe polish from my balcony. i\\'ll lose all of my remaining friends (i have no idea how many friends i have left since my calls and texts have gone unanswered for days now), and have to resort to writing craigslist ads for new friends and a new phone, and then i\\'ll probably get murdered. all because i bought this stupid phone. thanks, samsung. thanks for ruining my life.btw, when it worked (for a month, before it\\'s \"waterproofing\" didn\\'t do it\\'s job) the phone was fine. like the s4, but faster. and with fingerprints. and a heart rate monitor. the screen was pretty, with a warmer tone than the s4. i wasn\\'t a fan of the \\'recents\\' button instead of a menu button, but i probably would have gotten used to it if i had the chance. i\\'m not afraid to try new buttons. the sound would get a bit buzzy if you listened to headphones with the big charger plugged in, but that was okay too. everything fine. my wife loves this great smartphone, excelent service great item love this kind of phones great price value relation i got an amazon gift card when i did my taxes...that was my first mistake. once i got the card, i had to spend it...i looked at phones and ordered a cheap iphone...but after i month i realised it was not coming...i have asked for my money back... item received with wrong charger powerful smart phone perfect bought this phone a couple weeks ago, it has been fantastic,im not realy a smart phone geek but buying a 2nd one for my wife my carrier is t moble and l have great reception and good battery life an great product very recommendable good good product fantastic phone! would be much better with expandable storage, but google is beginning to take apple\\'s philosophy on product design, so that is to be expected.the phone is snappy and charges fast, and the camera is absolutely top-notch. the fact that it works with all major carriers gives me the freedom to not feel tethered to my current company.highly recommended! nice phone. i just couldn\\'t get a reliable signal since it was an international version. pointless to have a phone i can not use. also theread we\\'re times when the phone would get hot when charging it. i used to charger that came with the phone. the finger print scanner is all that great either. i love the look and size of the phone, but having no service most of the time suck. love it! bought almost two years ago to use on project fi, great phone and service is not working and i coundn\\'t return on time. so i wasted my money. this was a bad desition. i regret about that. i really love this phone but arrived with an european travel adapter useless in america, i had to buy another charger, that\\'s why i do not give five stars. the product specs and description should mention about this adapter. fire flame af 5 stars because the shipping was fast and i love the gold platinum. its brand spanking new. i cracked the seals myself. im from the bahamas and the international version works perfect with my prepaid carrier. it is 100% unlocked. and 100% working. id defiantly purchase again.if you like this review or if you found it helpful, please click yes below. thank you! bien great buy! good does not work great the phone i got a was in good condition as far as looks go and for the most part everything worked.the reason i didnt like the phone i got was because it liked to shut down when in use and mad it impossible to use. it\\' was like brand new phone arrived broken and i was so embarrassed since i had bought this as a gift for a friend and imagine my horror when he pulled the plastic of f and opened the boxand the screen was shattered while the screen plastic was still on the phone and the battery was in the box. i bought this phone since it was factory unlocked so didn\\'t think that using any carrier sim would be a problem. save your money and time and yourself the embarrassment. never buying phones from amazon ever... this phone is pretty cool. it comes with a case, charger, phone screen protector and headphones. i like this phone a lot for what it does. the only reason i did not rate it with 5 stars is because it is kind of slow but then again it gets all android apps and is probably the best phone i have purchased for the price. the only app i have had a problem with using is google maps which is huge. however, considering all the accessories come with including the screen protector and case i would give it 4 1/2 but that\\'s not an option on amazon lol. it is compatible with my lifestyle as college student and mom. i would recommend buying if you are looking for a phone that is simple, cheap and effective. so far, so good! this is a really handy little device. i\\'ve used it in california, utah and mexico. i look forward to trying it in china.great battery life. it is ok very good condition and the best every thing works i am talking about the software the internet it works whit all the conexion to wifi the playstore is very good i like it i think its defective or something and i cant upload pics as fast as my other phone and it doesn\\'t have google play store to get more games or widgets etc hard to believe in 2016 this is my first smart phone (forced to upgrade by at&t dropping 2g coverage the end of the year). i\\'m quite happy with it. the screen is large and easy to see except in direct sunlight. the camera is good quality. haven\\'t done much yet with video. texting is so much easier than the flip phone i was using. still learning, but is intuitive. not having much luck connecting to wifi managed by older routers. setting up router and phone profiles to match each other hasn\\'t worked. it took a bit of tinkering, but finally managed to get my home linksys router that is only about a year old to connect. great phone. s little bigger than i thought. great phone, battery lasts a lot (which is a real plus in my on call nights at the hospital), really reliable, im missing some things from my blackberry z10 but very minor like the integrated hub, the camera is very vivid, the screen size is perfect for reading books or articles.about the seller, excellent customer support, very straightforward dealing with issues and a great deal of patience. my sincere congratulations. wanted to even buy more excelent! it will not charge my iphonne 6 plus thats why i bought it!! very good, but is not work one of the two sim. once the phone was turned found out from verizon it was defective. could not see incoming calls only if left on voice mail never new who was calling excelente vertical line on the screen. too bad i had an iphone - hated it. small screen, restrictive apps - too controlling!! a swype keyboard absent from the iphone and the small size were big pet peeves. had an htc evo 4g prior to it and wanted to go back to the android system, so i had an htc inspire which was very similar to the evo and back to enjoying my cellphone app experience. after researching wanted to now try a samsung galaxy that was relatively inexpensive to try for 6 months or so and see if i want one of the current htc\\'s or samsung\\'s. when i received it everything was as expected and it is a great phone. the one con i have is that the micro-usb connector was defective, returned this and bought another from the same seller. (not their fault - it was in new packaging.) hence learned that micro-usb connectors can be somewhat of an issue with the pre-samsung s5\\'s, but with many youtube video\\'s on replacing a bad connector, i\\'m not worried about it as long as i get time with the phone before it needs replacing. would have given 5-stars but the connector issue is a small concern. almost all these phones from many makers pre-dating the past year had connector issues. i can even remember my htc evo getting loose and needing replacement under my warranty. so, while rating it a 4, i would have given it a 4.5. love everything else about it, which is why i ordered a replacement. the power button didn\\'t even work and when i took the back off it was obvious that it was very very cheaply made i am so displeased. i wish i could get a refund. this is horrible. the phone is used and was not unlockedi have to unlocked the phone and cut my card.best regards phone cracked in my pocket within 3 days nooooo works great to receive and open it seems of good quality wine in a box well protected. the number of stars not complete because i have not completely exceeds my expectations it\\'s hard to meet my expectations but this product did. arrived fast and safe. so far so good. i was happy to find this. thought you couldn\\'t buy just the clip. increíble ‼️‼️‼️gracias this phone is very slow. also, it does not keep a very long charge. additionally, it is very difficult to find a case that fits. i ordered several cases only to find out that the advertised product did not fit. do not buy this phone. you will not be happy with it. this phone is awesome, and the price was excellent. my daughter is very pleased with this phone. just got itnothing i don\\'t like about it yetexcept i had to order a 2gb micro memory cardit messed up my 8gb and i had to reformat it perfect i like this phone. it\\'s way batter than i thought and it works in venezuela perfectly. everything ok works well and just as new this phone is great. the small annoyances of the 4s are gone with the 5. and buying refurbished is even better. a practically new phone for half the price? sold! when i first received my phone i was elated. a note tablet for less thann $200. too good to be true. received my phone in april. it stopped working around august 25th. and now its september 10th and the phone wont even come on unless i plug it to the charger and keep it in. and even with that, the phone shows an all white screen. i cant see anything! when i unplug the charger its a black and white screen sort of like an old tv without an antenna and i can barely see what im doing. and then it cuts off.. smh this is the worst company ever. don\\'t waste your time or money. at first everything wll be good and you\\'ll feel like you\\'ve gotten the best deal ever... not... bad company. cheap product. if your looking for a phone that will last only 6 months or less then this it the one for you. other than that, stay away!!!!!!!!!!!!! purchased this phone for my cousing overseas but it couldn\\'t be used, so i had to return it, can\\'t tell how it works... i just got the iphone and it won\\'t cut on i was crushed when this phone stopped working. the screen stopped responding. there should be a way to fix it via the internet. i miss it, it was great. i still have it should there be a way, that someone could inform me not long after purchasing this product it already is making me regret it. it randomly goes black and doesn\\'t allow me to restart it or turn it back on. after reading the reviews about some users experiencing glitches and malfunctions i should have went with my gut and not purchased this product. don\\'t make the same mistake i did, you truly do get what you pay for. everything washington ok i was very very disappointed. this was the second htc a9192 inspire 4g. when my daughter received the first phone, she was so very excited because she was getting an early christmas gift to take pictures and send them to her friends. she was not able to send nor receive pictures. we took the phone to t-mobile and they changed the settings but it still did not work so we returned it and purchased another. amazon tried to make it right by sending it 2 days deliver so we would have it before christmas but the delivery was delayed and i did not receive the phone till christmas eve. i returned from work on christmas eve and learned that the new phone did not work. i took it to the at&t store and they told me that the phone was damaged as it would not stay on, even after being charged overnight. now, it will be a sad christmas because not only could my daughter not take pictures but she does not have a phone. if you are buying this smarphone to using it in argentina, be aware that the only version that works with 4g there is the ale-l23. it was good really nice phone more than expected for that price love it and that is all that i have to say about this product! great phone. wish u had informed me it was an at&t phone did not receive the charger that was suppose to come with phone. international version is not unlocked. i could not use the phone so i had to send it bad. excellent product, it\\'s unlocked i\\'m using it in venezuela. great phone. best android i\\'ve had so far. a little laggy on things like snapchat sometimes but definitely would recommend to someone who\\'s looking for a new phone and not wanting to spend a million dollars. cannot receive all text on t-mobile 4g...i have done everything from factory reset to latest update and still not able to receive text everything was ok. it was good when i first got it, ran really smoothly, nice size and price but soon began to deteriorate. and i mean soon. i have had it only 6 months and am ready for a new phone. it\\'s starting to run very slow and apps are crashing left and right. it even rebooted on me once. the camera is trash unless you are in perfect lighting and the camera angle is much too narrow. don\\'t buy it. i wish i had done better research on it. my daughter loves it!!! didn\\'t have the galaxy s6 logo on the back though. this phone sucks..the ear piece is low...the battery is terrible... the key board is just said ...when u trying to enter a card number or even when texting it types n the wrong letter or number...i\\'m scared to purchase another ...do anyone have and idea brands to buy for straight talk services i had this phone for two months now the speakers out smh i bought this phone, and after about 7 weeks of working perfectly, suddenly overnight while placed on charge, instead of charging the battery, in the morning it was almost completely drained. it subsequently did drain totally and the phone died. i bought a new battery, and the same thing happened - as soon as i plugged it in to re-charge, it started discharging! very strange. anyway, this vendor would not accept the product back without all the manufacturer\\'s original packaging, and amazon have refused to help, even though i\\'m a prime member. so, keep your original packaging or you could end up with a phone that doesn\\'t work and no recourse. my next stop is samsung - oh great, just what i need to fill my day with! nice slim line phone, easily fits in pockets & purse pouches. bought it and worked fine at first now 2 months later phone freezes and cuts off randomly it is good. charger is samsung charger great phone. i love it. despite the negatives below.some things:- i cracked the screen and apparently even the smallest crack on screen makes the touch unresponsive rendering the phone useless. i got it replaced and it works fine now. i think to fix just the screen is more expensive than other flagship phones like samsung. it cost me $230 in the states to fix. in order to fix they have to remove everything from the phone to get toit.- the battery is hard to remove. you have to heat the back and pry it open to get to the battery.- i haven\\'t dunked my phone completely in the water or anything. but i\\'m not exactly careful when it comes to water and it works fine. examples include me using phone when bathing with wet hands, rain, spills and putting phone under a running faucet to clean it lol.- there is complaints of the phone getting very hot and overheating. honestly its not that bad, any phone can get hot after prolonged use and i have never had it overheat to the point where it shuts down . i think that when i first got the phone it would get hotter quickly opposed to how it is now. my theory is that it was a new unused phone and was not used to being used as much as it is now.- if i think of anything else i\\'ll come back good the phone look snice but it real slow and keeps freezing up my phone continuously shuts down by itself exellent i love my new wrist watch but it\\'s not water proof. it does everything the seller said it would. this phone is turning out to be my favorite cellphone. the only flaw is in order to get the back up button to go onto the screen, you must swipe upwards at the very bottom of the screen a few times to register it on the screen but other than that its perfect in many ways. for one its unlocked! bonus! 2. it has an easy to use highly effective system with fast internet. 3. the screen is 6\" which is perfect for viewing videos. 4. it isn\\'t super clogged up with apps that i hate. another bonus! great phone! came faster then expected, thanks cellathon. i\\'ve used androids and iphones, so this is the first time i used a windows phone. so as i\\'ll be using this as my work phone, i\\'ll be learning and getting use to the phone. it;s good. great size. about the same as the samsung galaxy s5, but without (so far) the display problem drama. great pure android unlocked phone. at&t network works fine and so does verizon. (i have not used it with any other carriers). note that if you are moving from a locked feature phone to a smart phone like the 5x, you will probably have to transfer your phone book by purchasing a sim reader and then upload the address book .vcf file to google cloud, as i had to. like the kindle fire\\'s link to amazon. , this phone is solidly linked to google and works best in the google sphere.i recommend buying this phone directly from google as they offer an extended warranty that is not available through amazon or other second party dealers.why four stars? one feature we would like, the ir \"blaster\" is not included, meaning it can\\'t be used as a multimedia remote control. we also found that the alarm app supplied by google hung after notification with no way to turn it off except by rebooting. and there appears to be little if any water resistance. no ip-65 or ip-67 rating. battery life till recharge notification is 1-1/4 to two days with minimal calling. very good phone. i am from the caribbean, and i had no problems with it. would highly recommend. i received my phone yesterday and it worked perfectly. i had a slight problem but the seller was fast to solve it!! good product this phone is an excellent phone. however, it\\'s only for sprint customers . the phone bill is $100.00 a month and it does not come with a sim card. great little phone i bought this phone for someone else. this is a good value phone with many features at a much lower price than offers from samsung and apple. on the other hand there is one issue that i noticed when speaking with someone who is using this phone. the microphone. if you ever heard of someone talking directly in to a microphone by being too close to it and producing a muffling sound, this is what this phone sounds like when i call it. i\\'m not sure if this is some kind of defect or not but having the person switch to a different phone made the problem go away. this is a problem since i can\\'t understand what is being said. supposedly no one else has complained about this so far. excellent phone, very pleased. no issues at all so far pretty good for a cheap phone! please note, this is my one day review. the only slight issues i had were: 1. getting the microsd seated properly. i had to remove it a couple of time to get the phone to read it. 2. small internal memory. you can switch some apps to your memory card, but not all. consequently, you will need to stick to apps you actually use. if you are an app hog, this phone isn\\'t for you.phone, messaging, battery life, dual-sim, data all work as advertised. it is a slightly old-style capacitive screen, but it really isn\\'t bad... especially for an adult with big fingers.best of all, it is android 5.1.i needed an inexpensive unlocked phone and this worked-out well ... excellent phone.. easy, quickly and light i had it for 2 weeks and now its broken can i request another one out of my warranty i love windows phones. i\\'ve had android and i couldn\\'t wait until they started making windows again. i bought one with a lot of memory since the memory chips in the android phones do not work as advertised. this one has 32 gb and so far holds all the pictures, music, and audible books i want and i am no where near the memory limit.what i don\"t like:mine came speaking french and did not have a qwerty keyboard. fortunately, i knew enough french to fiddle with it, then gave up and let my 13 year old figure out how to turn it to english. then i finally discovered that if you remove chinese as the keyboard/language option, it goes back to qwerty keyboardit has a good memory, but you can\\'t add a sd or micro sd card to it.the maps i downloaded work 20% of the time, and never when i\\'m lost and need them, usually only on my street when i\\'m pretty sure i know how to get home.i have trouble downloading any pictures that are sent from android/iphones. i usually text them and say - can\\'t see it - it\\'s annoying. probably just a setting, but i\\'ve had it over a month and i still can\\'t receive pics.i have yet to figure out how to get it to work on data v wifi. better consult a 12 year old huh?what i like:the memory - it rocks!i have security cameras from blu iris that i monitor from my cell phone - this has enough memory to see my cameras when the wi-fi work.i love love love the way it interacts with audible - i love listening to audio books and this app for windows on this phone works seamlessly so i can pop between stories with ease.i love that is ok with syncing my 5 or so email accounts for business work, kids, etc so that i can see all of them separated as they should be on my phone.i love windows. it\\'s how tech should be. my son was very satisfied it is ok very good condition and the best every thing works i am talking about the software the internet it works whit all the conexion to wifi the playstore is very good i like it excellent best customer service you definitely earned 5 stars phone in perfect condition works really fine thank you !!! horrible, the phone arrived on time and i went to a t-mobile store to have it set up as soon as i got it! after my card was put in, i couldn\\'t get anything to work. it was locked, maybe it only works for verizon phones...whatever. my punishment for buying a cheap phone online, it has cheap use. the back of the phone doesn\\'t even fit on properly, it\\'ll go 2/3 of the way in and then there\\'s a section of the back cover sticking out. it\\'s not even the same model! i got the same model at the t-mobile store for a cheaper price, only two weeks of use, and the best part? it actually works. it is very comprehesive, highly recommend i can\\'t unlock this phone..... i had emailed the seller if there is anyway i could get a faster ship date, and they said absolutely! and would get on it first thing the next day. so i received the phone within a week! in excellent condition! all original packaging and all that good stuff. i really appreciated how nice they were to me! the phone looks to be in great condition, however it\\'s not for me, it\\'s for my teenage sister so it\\'s not yet active. therefore i do not know how it functions, if it glitches, if the buttons don\\'t work, ect.... i hope nothing is wrong with the phone considering the amount of money i paid for it. and as buyers we shouldn\\'t have to worry about buying electronics that don\\'t work. there are some scratches on the front screen but other than that, that is all i can see wrong. and even then, it\\'s for my sister so she\\'s pretty great full she\\'s even getting a phone. pure junk. something for kids. whack programming. cheesy this is tiny! a lot of people think it is a toy, but i\\'ve been using it for about 2 months now and it works great. i just wanted something to talk and text, i use my tablet for the web searches and facebook, so i just wanted something that fit in my small purse nicely. i downloaded a swype app so i could text better because it is really difficult to text without it. i also get random texts every two weeks or so from godaddy and one other online place. i assume they got my info from this phone purchase because i never got them before. (hence the 4 star rating) it\\'s definitely a conversation piece. it uses real android technology, so my google calendar is on here (the only other thing i was hoping i wouldn\\'t lose when i went smaller) my husband loves his new phone! . fast service! good pefecto nice phone, pretty, work good, have everything that kids need. good and not expensive for a smart phone.essay to use i recently answered a question on whether the phone i bought was a clone or prefab. it is not a nokia android clone of the windows8 os. if it is a prefab, i don\\'t know. as i stated in the response, i thought nokia manufactured their phones in sweden not in hong kong. probably assembled in china and distributed to the international market out of hong kong. the phone was preconfigured for the hong kong market. though it was in hong kong english, it was easy enough to reset the phone without losing the app bundle it came with. apps were enough for video+music, camera, a driving navigator, a walking map, public transit, some nokia proprietary apps that work well; like the panoramic camera app that stiches together about 4 pictures. the mobile office suite excel, power point and word, with office 365 to sync with your other ms office software. i had to install a third party file manager app to access files on my sd card. 8 gigs onboard mem is ok. though if you want to save maps directly to the onboard mem, memory be eaten up fast. i loaded about 7 apps and have 2.68 gigs left. i mentioned that maps, because even though i asked the maps to load to the sd card, they did not. i was happy they didn\\'t, because transferring the sd card from my phone to my tablet, corrupted the data. i doubt it was an issue with the phone. however, i was overseas and needed the maps, and was thankful that they were on the phone\\'s memory. the phone arrived about a week before the \"no later than date\" which was about 3 weeks. i am rating this particular purchase at three stars for 3 reasons. first, the phone has a black back case and not red, as requested. sounds trivial, but i wonder what else was not \"as advertised\"? for example, at the vendor you will get the latest os with the latest bundle. i got windows 8.0, where at the vendor, the phone was loaded with windows 8.1. maybe not a big deal until i actually ask to upgrade the os. second, the phone runs hot when browsing the internet and also using gps actively (gps when in flight mode). so i wonder about the cpu. it is a 1.7 dual core, but so is my tablet that doesn\\'t run hot (significantly hot). i wonder if the phone is a prefab or if the chip is overclocked (inferior chip running faster than advised) to save on money. third, the initial price was attractive at about $277, but after paying $23 to ship to an fpo ae, the savings of purchasing online didn\\'t really outweigh the peace of mind of purchasing the same phone at a local vendor, where i can walk over and have it serviced or returned immediately if necessary. i would have paid $70 more at the local vendor. the battery life is decent lasting a whole day with some web browsing, watching around 1.5hrs of video, using the gps and a few short phone calls. when i did notice the phone getting hot, it did consume more battery life that usual. i was slightly worried that the g4 standard here in italy would not be compatible with the frequency published, but it works great. sometimes a webpage will hang, other times pages will pop right up. the webpages hanging are starting to get annoying. the windows8 interface for me is a breath of fresh air compared the android oss that i use on my samsung tablets. i find the interface to be simpler and quicker for that matter. they already seven months elsmartphone you buy blackberry bold 9700

i did not return it. the phone feels solid and fast. screen is beautiful. does not seem to have the touch screen stutter problem like the other blu phone i had. i bought this phone for it\\'s large battery, and it can last 2 days easily. with careful programming of when to turn wifi on, it can last even longer. very happy with it. very good great phone no issues for me almost a perfect phone for me i bought this for my son. his previous phone did not have sufficient storage. on this phone he was able to download all his favorite apps. i love the forward facing flash on this phone. i wish my phone had one. it is almost the same size as my note 4. he loved it. phone was as in better condition than described. 100% happy with this purchase and i would buy from this seller again. best phone i\\'ve ever had. i am not brave enough to test if it is waterproof. very nice phone. this phone works good. every performance are perfact. i\\'ve owned a lot of phones over the years. this has to be, by far, the worst. both my husband and i purchased this phone a few months ago. both of them are junk. my phones vibrates twice a day forcing a reboot to resolve. my husband\\'s vibrates twice a week. both phones brightness just magically get turned down on the lowest settings in the middle of using them forcing you to go into settings and adjust. some keys on phone require you to tap three or four times to get a response... if you want a paperweight or a vibrator - lol, then this phone is for you. as good as advertised......replaced same model, old one had liquid spilled on it and did not recover.....very satisfied with it..... the phone came damaged always turn off .. i need to change it .. can i do it something ? the problem was since first week of us i love it. its ok good phone :) great! i have only had it for a few days, but works and looks like new so far! my daughter loves it ended up not being able to use it on my plan, but very fast shipping and very nice phone. so this phone worked fine in the us. but i got it because it has international capabilities, however, when my mother took it to tanzania, it crashed,.. now i have to buy a new phone(-: the phone does not work.the screen goes blank the phone damaged in factory love the phone! exellent i bought it for someone as a gift for use overseas. she said that the phone works very well and seems to be satisfied. the phone is very user friendly and small enough to fit a woman purse. i consider it a good purchase. thanks excelent i love this phone. it is feature packed. dislikes only that there is a bot of bloatware, but you can disable it. the battery does not last long if you leave everything running though, so be sure to take advantage of disabling the bloatware. wow what a cell phone. amazed at what it can do. kit kat installed with no problem, sound and picture quality is amazing.fits nice in my hand. i was used to the note 2. but i am loving this one. a great price for a very smart phone. go google now ordered phone but it would not work with at&t. called company and told it was due to lack of towers. found that odd since my cell is at&t it is good. i am happy. excellent thanks. good excellent seller, recommend after using for only 1 month, the plastic hinge already broke. very disappointed. the kids love their iphone. had this for a few months now and can\\'t be happier with it. a great phone. excellent phone!!! this phone uses an old version of android. it is _not_ compatible with the googlevoice application. i wanted to be able to view voice mail on this screen - not just know i had a voicemail message. unfortunately, can\\'t do it. tech support claims they are working on it, but lots of posts on their support forum indicate that this is a long-standing issue. i\\'d recommend waiting for a phone that supports the newer android os before trying this again. i went back to the older grandstream (non-android) which works perfectly. best basic phone i\\'ve owned. even has touchscreen part to write your text out my hand, pretty neat. fast, no freezing, no dropped calls. i did not realize that only had 500 mb of ram nice !! i love this phone! it can do everything you need it to, and it is fast. the other reveiws are just people who didnt take care of their items. i would buy again :d i love the phone. it\\'s exactly as described and it is working very very good. i got it 5 days ago and i haven\\'t have any problem with it. i\\'ll let you know if i have any in the next weeks. when i saw this product i was excited to see because i do not have to pickup phone while driving car can talk like james bond, easy alternate method for phone. i do not like the band and clock background of product. band is too hard not easy to put battery and had struggle. clock background does not look professional; i do not know how to change it at this moment. overall product delivery is ok and not good or excellent. one star i love this phone. my first iphone and its new, brand new. it was terrible. ordered the phone for my brother and it was working for about a month. all of a sudden the damn thing went blank. money down the drain. i demand a refund!! not even worth 1 star nice but lags after 6 months the phone has stopped working really unblocked phone. has russian in settings. excellent phone. i knew the s4 was the phone i wanted. i needed gsm quad-band factory unlocked for use with international pre-paid sims (specifically european and asian in the near future). this is the right phone. this one was for my wife and i bought another one on amazon for myself. the one i bought for myself was technically international, it does accept sims from south america, all over north america, and the caribbean. however, that other one does not accept asian or european sims. be careful what you buy on amazon i guess is the lesson learned. other reviews on this phone seem to state they did not get what they expected from this vendor (t-mobile unlocked rather than truly factory unlocked, etc.). i did get exactly what i needed from this vendor, however another failed me. so, again, buyer beware. also, don\\'t open your phone\\'s box in the dark because you are so excited it has arrived :-) i did that with the americas phone and am now stuck with it.however, just to reiterate, this phone is exactly what i wanted and fit the bill perfectly. my experience with this particular phone is completely perfect. purchased for a friend. she\\'s enjoying her new phone although i had an okay/bad experience with blu nonetheless, she likes it. its not a good cell phone!!!! first, a little background, for perspective: i\\'m an ex-iphone user, migrated from iphone to android a few years ago, for the freedom and open-ness of the os. i\\'ve really liked the android os and the phones i\\'ve bought along the way. a few months ago i bought a lumia 521 with a new metro pcs account. the lumia 521 introduced me to windows 8 phone os and i was amazed at how fluid, intuitive and fun it is - so i decided to fork out for a premium windows phone ... which is what brought me to the lumia 820.the nokia lumia 820 is solid. it\\'s heavy in the hand and has a stable, durable feel to it. the display is vibrant and beautiful. reviewers and \"experts\" out there on the web can say anything they want about resolution, rag on the pixel density, whatever - but this phone, in your hand is beautiful. colors pop, photos are crisp and videos look great!as was the case with my (brief) experience on the lumia 521, this is quick, nimble, fast. every operation is there when called for, tasks present themselves immediately and close just as quickly. there\\'s something about this windows os that must be much less resource-intensive, less hungry than other mobile os\\'s, because things just pop and fly all over the place.the tiles ... live tiles, that represent what feels like a living, breathing os interface. you see the faces of your contacts and friends rotating in and out of the \"people\" tile ... facebook posts of friends \"pop up\" in live time, as they are happening ... news updates circulate in a tile, the tile suddenly flips over to reveal another breaking headline ... the tile from your songza app suddenly flips over to say \"it is friday night\" (or late saturday morning, etc.) ... the photos tile rotates through your albums, scrolling slowly and continuously ... nothing stands still, this tiled-interface is alive!more on tiles ... you can size and re-size your tiles, according to taste; regular (square), large (rectangle that covers width of the screen) or small (one quarter size of regular). you can even pin your favorite websites to the screen, each in a tile of it\\'s own. i\\'ve got four favorite playlists (from nokia music) pinned to my screen, each re-sized to small, and they form a little music \"block\", the size of a regular tile!the lumia 820 has nfc capability and wireless charging - something i didn\\'t think i\\'d ever need or use, but i did fork out for the charging plate and it\\'s been a very nice bonus. i\\'ve already grown lazy, with the ability to simply place the phone on it\\'s back for a charge ... no plugs, cables or hassles.customization! unlike other phones in the lumia lineup, this one has interchangeable back plates. once in place, it looks like a solid piece of polycarbonate. you can make this a cyan phone, a bright red phone, yellow, white or black, simply by putting a different (removable) back plate on it. you can order these with or without nfc and wireless charging capability. this phone was black when i bought it, i\\'ve since changed it to cyan (and have other colors on order).is the 920 a better phone? how about the 928? well, the specs are better on those phones, but for me, this is the sweet spot. it\\'s smaller than the 920, but with the same screen size, and (again), with the joy of body / color customization. processing speed? system ram? what are those??? what do i care? when a phone is as fast, fluid, stable and zippy as this is, who cares? when you get a phone that performs as beautifully as this, you can forget about specs (and forget the \"expert\" opinions from the tech sites). none of it matters.apps ... yes, you hear a lot of whining, complaining, hand-wringing criticism of the windows app store and it\\'s \"horrible dearth of apps\". if you believe what you read out there on the internet, you probably figure they\\'ve got about 10 or 20 apps in the store. i don\\'t know who these people are, or what they have on their own phones, but inasmuch as the windows store has over a hundred thousand apps (126,000 as of last night) ... i feel that is enough for me (and for any reasonable person). sure, you can bolster your app store to a million, 50 million, a billion, whatever - but when 50,000 of those apps are flashlights (as opposed to one flashlight), how is that improving your app experience?the 8gb of internal space ... once the os requirements are subtracted, you\\'ve got about 5 or 6 gigs to yourself. unlike it\\'s bigger brethren in the lumia family, this one comes with a micro sd slot. i\\'ve got a 32gb card in mine, and have set the phone to load all photos, music and videos to the card (rather than to internal storage). that should hold me for awhile.the camera ... with carl zeiss optics and dual led flash, the 8.7 megapixel camera and quality of your photos will be excellent. i\\'ve also loaded an hdr app from the store and have experimented with it, garnering some very nice results. i\\'ve been taking photos for instagram, foodspotting, facebook and twitter so far, nothing that requires a critical eye or instrument. i have also set my phone to auto-upload all photos and videos to skydrive, so i\\'ve got an instant backup of everything i\\'ve taken.i\\'m not going to spend any time hashing-out or \"reviewing\" technical details, you\\'ll get plenty of that in other reviews (and websites). suffice it to say, this is one of the best and the most enjoyable phone i\\'ve ever owned. no problems. the phone itself is just great, but when i got the package the phone box was not sealed and it turned out that the charger was for uk, so the store added a big adapter, and the worse was that the headphones inside the box didn\\'t correspond with the ones that are showed in the publicity. good product, good for sony, but bad store to buy. my personal advise: if you- don\\'t like the bulky feeling of today\\'s smartphones in your pocket and wish for something extremely light and easy to carry around- are fed up with constantly checking, reading, writing \\'stuff\\' on your smartphone- would like to bar your phone interfering with your interactions with your surrounding- don\\'t mind not having a 5mp camera- or want to carry a tiny bond-style phone for security reasonsthen it\\'s a great buy.i used to have a 4\\'\\' lg and having replaced it with this one more than a month ago, i can tell you now that i feel much \\'lighter\\' and happier. not because the phone is the best in the market but because i\\'m one of the above type of customers. since i bought it, i am much more engaged with my surrounding and have my hands & eyes free.pros: not just small but extremely lightweight and cute to carry around. the chances of losing/forgetting it somewhere is extremely low because you won\\'t take it out of your pocked unless you have a notification or a call. similarly, the chances of someone stealing it is rather low, in my opinion, \\'cause at first sight, nobody thinks that this is an actual smartphone with all features! i guess it\\'s also fair to say that the phone decreases your chances of being run over by car significantly because you\\'ll watch the traffic more carefully. it has all the benefits of an android phone. spotify, soundcloud, fb messenger, maps, front and read cameras etc. it has everything you\\'d need. i\\'ve never experienced memory shortage - gdrive, spotify, soundcloud, podcastrep, calendar etc. are all installed without any memory problem. since you don\\'t use it much, the battery is also pretty sufficient. but i think the best feature is that it has a record feature for fm radio!cons: the touchscreen is slow, sometimes you\\'ve to touch things twice. the touchscreen is too small, sometimes you have to touch the screen couple of times until you hit the right thing (my advice is to go for google voice keyboard or swipe keyboard. it works pretty well and swiftly). i don\\'t know whether this is a general problem but mine sometimes doesn\\'t show the battery correctly. i mean, for almost an entire day it said the battery is %61 and i was already wondering what\\'s going on.. yeah, the next morning i found it laying dead on the floor. but as i said, the battery life is pretty sufficient. mine just doesn\\'t show it correctly sometimes and this might lead to miscalculations (just saying). this is a very good entry level, mid range device. it is not going to blow your mind away, but it is good enough to get you through the day. i like the design and some of the special functionality like the floating touch and the fact that you can use it with gloves on. the camera is very good to be a 5mp sensor. the only con that i find with it is that it doesn\\'t have a front facing camera. very speedy no excessive amounts of stuttering, lag. very good product from sony. very good so far this is a great phone. built-in wifi, gps, pdf reader, word, excel and powerpoint editing apps among others. you can also download tons of apps. the phone is relatively small for the features it offers and very very thin. although the keys are compacted/close you will have no problems typing. great phone. has some rays on the display but they\\'re very small 8-10. great seller, i recommend i love this phone. i had been looking for an inexpensive android phone and this is it. it does everything i want it to do and more. great phone, many interesting features. beautiful resolution. works well. only \"gripe,\" and it isn\\'t such a huge one, if i take sim card out for any reason, contacts are gone when i reinsert sim in phone. contacts remain on sim, but don\\'t show back up on phone. probably an operator problem, but i found that a bit annoying. it has great reception and sound. otherwise, it is a great phone and i would recommend it to anyone looking for \"blackberry\" equivalent. i actually have a blackberry curve (older version) and i like the nokia much better. excellent good works aspected. great good good probably is a really nice phone but despite watching 2 u tube videos on how to remove the back of the phone so the battery and sim card can be inserted, i could not get the back off. broken thumb nails down to the quick of the nails on both hands to show for my efforts. followed all directions to the letter and the back just will not release so i have requested a return from the seller and am waiting for an rma. i purchased this phone on july 24th and the battery died within 3 months. i am not satisfied with a phone that stops working within 3 months. also do not use wireless place to buy this product. they told me it was not their fault for selling a defective product.to be clear, i replaced the battery and the phone still won\\'t work. it\\'s not even the battery, its the defective phone. i can\\'t download whatsapp and messenger on my blackberry 9780 good package .. nice phone ... as per my expectations .. thanks it\\'s a low grade phone , i returned it the same day i love it. this phone is great. it was fast shipping and accurrate discription.. i love it phone is perfect size for me, and is intuitive to use. can\\'t beat the price for all the features and 32gb!! it is close to the galaxy 5 without the cost. processor is quick. camera works well. battery charge could last longer, then i would give it 5 stars. it\\'s a great iphone at a great price. love it! nice phone but battery life is only 2 - 3 hrs on my new phone the phone finally arrived (2nd attempt) but it was worth the wait. beautiful phone. i have no problems with it so far. not a feature rich phone but a good value. love it fast delivery ,good product . thanks. when plugged into charger touch screen doesn\\'t work right most of the time. other than that its a great value for a great phone. got this for my 12 year old and its an he loves it because of the slider and easy to use keypad i love my new phone. and it arrived fairly quickly. i am very happy. the phone has a very good camera, beautiful display and responds well to touch. it hangs at times but i guess most other phones do that i purchased this as a gift for my husband and he just loves it. a bit annoying to have to manually delete receiving calls or messages from watch even if you deleted it from, but otherwise a really great product. product is as described with the exception of the uk and european adapters, which were not included. i noticed others made the same comment so the pictures should be updated to reflect the actual contents. otherwise product is new and performs as advertised. i have installed an international sim card (which is suprisingly expensive for the people calling and texting me) and will be using the phome in germany and the middle east later this month. excelente i can\\'t buy a micro sim card for it anywhere this is my first smart phone, so i think it is a good one to start with. only one problem i have run into, but not big enough for me to return it. on occasion, when using the dial pad, it will go blank and i have to keep pressing it back on. i mainly use the phone for locating places and for apps like my bank, restaurant locator, cheap gas locator... that type of stuff. also, i text more than i talk on my phone and that has been working well. at first the cell worked perfectly but now the touch screeen sucks very limited compatibility. even took it to the \"geek squad\" (which was more than i should have to do) and they could not sync it. do not recommend. ok phone, pretty slow though. crashes fairly often, especially when trying to text or check email. ok for the price. good everything ok best phone i have had in a long time. love the speed in searching mode. :) just... perfect. easy to put on your phone. protects your phone. i have dropped it a couple times and no anxiety about it being broke. would recommend to my friends. can\\'t customize to israel.can\\'t find network ,call and recedive calls frequntlywithout knowing.went to a lab, didnt help.zooming probloem during video.i bought 2.both have the same problem.1 has probloms with finding network and keeping network, finding and keeping wifi, camera zoom during video. one week after used it the phone start acting up, the screen frozen and intermittently lost signal.not only that, the phone easily to get hot, i see many people has the same issues. i guess the phone it self has hardware problem. i return it back very good this phone survived a 50 minute laundry wash cycle today because it was hiding in a pair of jeans. very impressed. this is a very good phone. the price is very reasonable and it functions just as good as those posh, ridiculously expensive phones. i had to return it. i have t-mobile and it kept disconnecting from the network. i am really bummed because it is such a great phone. works fine! i was super pleased with the phone and i will definitely be getting more. really like the phone. came without a charger. was told they would send it. they never did. i have it for a about a year and works great! great phone. no issues. if you\\'re in the united states, lte bands will not be compatible but gsm and hspa are compatible. i\\'m happy with the purchase. excelent excellent very nice windows phone, great price. bought it to replace a blackberry that wore out in slightly over a year and did not want toextend my att contract. my only concern is that the back is somewhat flimsy and might come off after extended use. phone was ok. returned because screen cracked while in my pocket with no other objects. sound on alarm was too soft to wake you. i\\'m very happy with the purchase! the phone works perfectly, and as i expected. my one small complain is that the top part of the screen kinda edge out of its case, so i occasionally have to push it back in so it\\'s snug. it doesn\\'t come out but starts to edge out, which i\\'m guessing is because the screen was once replaced. i\\'ve replaced a screen in the past and the same thing would happen because some of the glue and snuggness of everything is lost when parts are changed. in any case, its not enough to bother me and i\\'ve got a good case for it, so i\\'m looking forward to lots of time with this phone. for the price it\\'s excellent. i really love this phone. just as seller say it would be the phone works fine but it\\'s not possible to set it in spanish, it only can be set in english or asian languages. if there was an option to do less than one star i would. first off it was a day late when i paid extra for speedy delivery. that didn\\'t bother me until i realized i got screwed all togethr. this phone is not as advertized at all. i wasn\\'t even able to activate it through my carrier. looks nice on the outside but once you turn it on, even the screen seems off. i suggest amazon remove this advertizment all together. if you\\'re lucky and you get this phone, it\\'s great. but beware of fraudulent sellers (e.g. s***ty_services_worst_practices)let\\'s face it. someone buying am \"unlocked international version no warranty \" phone, is doing it for only one reason: to use it outside the us.so a crook seller sees an oportunity to commit fraud: let\\'s sell them some $50 used cel phone with a sticker that says i9195 for $300 and when they noticed they where ripped off, they\\'ll be out of the country and won\\'t be able to complain.that was almost my story. luckily i was able to notice on time, that the model number behind the battery was for an used s7562 (a $50 cel) and not a new i9195 (a $300 one). the worst was that this is a fraud and not an error, since the sticker outside said i9195. they know what they where doing, and they do it on purpose, to criminally cheat us. i tried to contact the seller, but they didn\\'t want to solve the problem, they even insulted me. luckly, i contacted amazon and they refunded me the money and i bought it again in another seller, and got the i9195 i wanted (which is great). but i was almost ripped of by this \"quality_services_best_practices\" crooks. do you want to risk buying from crooks like these?read the other reviews for this phone. and you\\'ll se some happy people and some angry ones. this is not due to the phone itself. some sellers are s***ty_services_worst_practices and they commit fraud to people, hoping they can\\'t complaing from abroad.the i9195 is a great phone, just google i9195 review and you\\'ll see. but you are reading this review, because you pay for the phone you get, and at first i didn\\' get what i ordered.be extremely aware from what seller you buy this \"international\" phone, because some are just waiting to rip you off great purchased to use on cricket wireless (at&t towers). arrived as promised via amazon. first impressions are all positive. price was great and phone seems to be very well built. this version has an 8 megapixel rear camera and comes with 8 gigabytes of internal storage. wireless and bluetooth work as they should, and 4g network activity is as expected. the only minor concern that i have is the screen. yes, they do provide a screen protector, but it\\'s difficult to apply properly. i wonder why they don\\'t use gorilla glass or something similar. even if it increased the cost by a few dollars, it would be well worth it. i am biased: i love blackberry phones. i owned the bold and the curve back in the early days of smartphones, then i got all caught up in the iphone craze. i came back to blackberry when, to my surprise, i discovered they were still in business and making great phones. i ditched the iphone, got a q10 and then a passport. i love, love, love bb10, the current os. but, like a lot of people, i really missed some of the apps i used on the iphone. of course, bb10 can run some android apps, just not all of them and some of them run poorly. then i found the priv. it\\'s an odd but swanky phone that people notice and you\\'ll enjoy using in public.first, let me say that it\\'s a near-top-of-the-line android phone, so if you like android, you\\'ll love the priv. blackberry has tweaked the os slightly and that tweaking seems to have improved the over all security of the phone. it comes with the google play store preloaded and that is the only place to get your apps, unless you want to download apkpure, another great source for android apps. your blackberry apps are not available for the priv. this is a blackberry phone in name only.second, this thing is fast! i mean blazing fast. i used the galaxy note (not sure which version) to compare, and the priv compares favorably, though the screen was slightly smaller. speaking of the screen, it\\'s a huge selling point. streaming videos (netflix or ones locally stored) look awesome.third, the rear facing camera is slightly better than average. the front facing camera is not the greatest. so if you are a compulsive, narcissistic selfie addict, you\\'ll be underwhelmed. the onboard photography suit is pretty decent, though.fourth, the keyboards. yes, plural. the slide-out physical keyboard is good, although the keys seem small to me. mind you, i was used to the awesome passport with it\\'s large keys, so my judgment might be a bit subjective. typing using the physical keyboard was a bit of a chore, and eventually i found myself slapping it shut so i could use the virtual keyboard, which is outstanding, i have to say. blackberry has scored with its virtual keyboard; it\\'s far, far superior to the iphone keyboard.lastly, i give this phone 5 stars because it is a good piece of technology. people get all caught up in buying a \"name,\" like samsung or iphone, but the blackberry priv holds its own in a world awash with good quality phones. one final point, the build quality is unsurpassed. this thing is tough; a lot tougher than it feels, which is to me, its only downside - how it feels in the hand. maybe it\\'s the slider mechanism, but this phone doesn\\'t feel as \"solid\" as the passport or the q10. but it is, i assure you. i\\'ve dropped it a couple of times and you\\'d never know it.in the end, i still prefer the bb10 os to the android os; it\\'s smoother, prettier, and more intuitive. my passport remains by favorite, go-to phone. but there\\'s no denying that the priv is a top notch smartphone that is hard to beat and fun to use. it was way overpriced when it first came out, but the price has really come down in recent months, making the priv a wise choice. thought this was a 5s otterbox case but it ended up being just a 5 so now i can\\'t use the thumbprint sensor on the phone but it is otterbox so can\\'t complain. comes with tons of sony bloatware. doesn\\'t hold up. gets very hot. no support from sony if you\\'re in the us market and need a repair. screen cracked after fall from 3 feet onto concrete floor. had protective case and tempered glass screen protector, but still cracked on impact. now it\\'s an expensive paperweight. excelente the build quality of the phone is great.. however, the phone performance is very slow /laggy when doing \"normal\" tasks (opening, closing apps, browsing through the phone)i\\'m also not impressed with the battery life of the phone. very much i just received this phone - from mega mobiles - and it arrived brand-new in a sealed box. the phone is very well built and beautiful - with a gorgeous screen. it was unquestionably new in the box and mega mobile is now a trusted seller for me. i have only had it two days but it seems to be quite a battery burner - my battery app is reporting almost 4% usage per hour. this brings up my major issues with wp8: you have to buy apps to show simple, stupid stuff like battery percentage. this is unacceptable and i see why wp continues have adoption issues. another case in point - say you want to use carddav to get your google contacts on the lumia? forget about it - it doesn\\'t work!! my phone arrived with the lumia amber version - supposedly the carddav issue is fixed in lumia black - due out in the future. also, trying to set up gmail thru wp8\\'s gmail \"tool\" did not work well - i kept getting memory errors and had to set up gmail using the imap functionality. for crying out loud, it\\'s 2013, and ms can\\'t figure out how to set up an error-free gmail connection? although the phone itself is beautiful - and i really like the hardware - ms has continued to be behind the power curve with windows phone 8. oh - back to battery percentage - there is still no way to have the battery percentage appear in the notification bar on top. even the live tile - which i paid $1.99 for - only updates once every 30 minutes. ok - enough complaining - there are some nice positives for wp8: ms doesn\\'t scan all of your e-mail (as far as i know, anyway) to try to target ads for you the way google does - and office documents look great (for a phone) since it includes office 365. overall, the phone is a keeper, because nokia did a fabulous job on the hardware end. received the wrong phone that was locked. very very bummed. great phone, last one was the moto g, love the larger screen. to early to tell so far so good ! the phone looks great, i love the phone but no 4g or lte on t-mobile network. false advertising by the seller ( mobile front ) when they say \" work gsm network only will not work with sprint, nextel, verizon etc\" what is the point of buying lte phone if it does not work!! . note you will only get h+ on t-mobile i bought the titan silver 64gb international unlocked. upgraded from the sony xperia z3 compact, which is a fantastic little phone in its own right. but this s6 edge + is lightning fast, incredible screen, the best camera i\\'ve ever seen on a phone and easily the best looking phone i\\'ve seen to date. the edge features are minimal and it\\'s not the easiest phone to hold, especially in a small hand since the back is flat instead of contoured. this is a minor issue that doesn\\'t personally take away from the experience. the build quality is superb, nothing feels cheap at all. and the gorilla glass 4 is incredibly strong so don\\'t worry about it being too fragile, i still wouldn\\'t recommend dropping it, but if you do there is a fair chance it will survive with little damage if dropped from waist height. all-in-all this is easily the best phone i\\'ve owned. i would highly recommend getting the samsung charge pad to go with it. it\\'s very convenient being able to just set it down and start charging instead of fumbling with the cable, it charges very quickly on the pad as well. the phone arrived in the white samsung box along with turbo charger, us plug adapter, uk plug adapter, samsung ear bud headphones and micro-sim port removal tool. all bagged up and packaged in amazon box. quality distributer and arrived earlier than scheduled. highly recommended, 5 stars phome did not last 2months before it stop working.. look at the battery part and found that the red dot had been cover over with a white dot. .do not trust the seller...purchase phone as new. thanks, this is the second unit of this same mobile i\\'ve bought and all is good wakala, the display stop work in two weeks!!!! i want my money back!!!!! an excellent phone. i can\\'t put it down. i like it because it\\'s faster than my old phone. excelent in all the ways... im so happy exelente my son loves his moto x. works well on selectel wireless/verizon network. the phone looks and functions fine with us phone carriers. the box the phone came in looked old and opened but the phone looked new but was the southeast asian model. the charging adapters are made for southeast asia. been htc user for years now and this product is best htc i had. awesome screen, wonderful and warm colors with amoled display, what i loved about screen is it doesn\\'t fade in sunlight..!!! rear cam though is 13 pix but still lacks the punch, though which pro mode you can create amazing pics. front cam is best in any phone in this range or of higher range.and yes i opened the box got to phone out booted it, in few minutes alert for android 6.0.1 update and bammm got android upgrade within first few minutes of unboxing phone. now who can give you that amazing service love it htc..!!!yes the speakers a little disappointing but then hey its a new thing they are trying. let\\'s talk about earphone with boomsound and dolby enhance..with in box ear set you get crisp sound and wonderful bass, get a better earphone and damnnnnn it\\'s again one the best sound in any phone on this range, it just phenomenal..!!as for htc sense yes it\\'s as smooth as always and the phone is fast and reaction for apps to open is swift.so yes with price you pay, you get a phone which more worth than what you pay for. stop listening to people complaining about it looks like iphone, this htc device here is better than some brands flagship devices.hence think to further if you feel like having it click that add to cart button..!!! you wont regret this was bought as a new in the box and it was new. they did not disclose that the manual was not in the box.the phone works great excelente i am totally satisfied. i don\\'t see a reason for buying an i phone or galaxy. this htc is perfect. it is a real smart phone. unlocked is the best deal. excellent phone and superb customer service.phone freezes at times but other than that i have no problems with device. reasonable price and good service great phone to work with great phone great deal! great mp3 player! i purchased this phone mostly for music playing. i had an htc evo 4g lte and this definitely doesn\\'t compare, but it meets my needs and was purchased at a reasonable price. the operating system is a little slow. it is visually appealing. it is easy to set up & operate. my sound quality pales in comparison to my htc. i do enjoy it is smaller and more compact than my htc because i typically carry in a sport band during exercise. good brings only good thing is the battery cell i\\'ve been using this type of phone for over 10 years. gave my first one to my wife when she broke her old candy bar type phone died. used my 2nd krzr till the speaker got so weak it was hard to hear it ringing. this is my 3rd one and it does every thing i expected.the only thing i found wrong with this phone is a flaw in the screen. there is a 3/8\" black line of dead pixies about 2 rows wide. i kept the phone because i found nothing else wrong and it works ok. too lazy to do the warranty return for such a small flaw since i\\'ll scratch the screen sooner or later my self. i have noticed that the software on the three krzr phones i\\'ve had and several others i\\'ve used all seem have slight differences in how some of the features are setup, it just takes a little time to readjust. over all the camera and size are just right. good battery life. at bottom page of downloading a map with free navigation [...], a charge for transferring any amounts of data over-the-air should be collected by any phone network. without a data plan, these providers automatically charge transferring data per kilobyte as a basic included feature. in addition, any nokia applications should link directly to the main browser of service network on the phone as a default without any exchange. as a result, a charge should be counted on the phone bill when starting an up-to-date of a firmware or downloading a new application over-the-air.final words, using wi-fi without any charge is only when i already controlled it with the following steps (while i do not need a data plan):1. select connectivity,2. select wi-fi/wlan (on second line because the default network is on the first line),3. select and connect an ip name (already knowing its wep),4. select starting browser within the above ip to surf the web by hitting it after connected. the data transferring onto the phone at this time is not through the phone network.(if going out of this path in order to select an internet global icon on menu, this action will turn off the already connected wi-fi instead of turning on the default network with an automatic charge).5. always make sure to select disconect wi-fi (on the same path). indeed, on the network browser is a must.one more thing, a gps device unit is the best, and it is completely free for any things. it is also fast, easy, and more technology. a-gps, one of applications on the phone causes spending more money because of transferring data over the air and through the phone network. never worked this crap and i have sent back to cellular gallery but amazon fix my problem thanks excelent very good it came in perfect conditions just i expected my phone was exactly as described, in great condition. it was wrapped securely in bubble wrap and came with everything it was supposed to. and it got to me very quickly. i love my phone and am glad i found one here in such perfect condition and for a great price i am very please with this phone so far. i received the phone this week and it works like a charm. it is very fast and responsive. i would definitely recommend this phone to my friends and family. i am an asus laptop user so i was very excited to find they have cell phones. great performance, perfect design i don\\'t have a lot of apps or photos or anything on my phone, yet it\\'s constantly telling me that i don\\'t have enough storage space. it\\'s always telling me i need to make updates, yet i am unable to, because there is not enough storage for the updates. also, the camera is terrible. works will with ting, and phone bill now a fraction of what it was. nexus is the only android phone i trust to have software updates for security issues over the long haul. i bought this phone in may and used it in asia in june. problem began when i switched to a local sim card and the time was wrong. when i removed the sim card the time was correct. so not too happy about that.now in august, my phone freezes a lot. i have to restart my phone many times. i\\'ve just restarted it before posting this.on a positive note: the camera is great for taking selfie. it has been over a week since i was promised to receive my merchandise, and yet i still have not received. i\\'m also unable to receive any information relative to tracking the product and determining a location. i am highly disappointed and feel this is bad customer service and unprofessional. great mid range phone. latest kit kat software and all of the lg software enhancements including \"knock,knock on\". very light, large screen with small bezels. using it with tmobile and gets hspa+ at around 10 to 15 meg download. surprised that many carriers haven\\'t offered it for sale. this phone is ok, it is the right phone for you if it is your first smart phone, otherwise, look something with more internal memory and better camera. so far i have been impressed with it. i was able to download all my apps i wanted plus. nice clear screen. just wish i could find an otter box for this model. this is the best phone deal on the market. i have nothing bad to say about this phone. i can\\'t believe how little i paid. very good product and delivered in a timely manner. the best phone i\\'ve ever had. works as it should. as described. 63 days after purchase it stopped working. it started with the \"7\" key not working and then progressed to none of the keys working. i tried taking out the battery, resetting the sims and turning it on and off. nothing. the keyboard is toast. so, i have to buy a new phone. don\\'t buy this phone. you will waste your money. as an additional note, the hinges were already starting to get loose. as you know, amazon only will take stuff back for 30 days so there is no recourse there. the best thing we can all do is post how bad the product is and warn others away. excelent phone and very nice features. the case is beautiful and fits perfectly. i ordered an otterbox prior to this one and it turned out to be a fake. the buttons are.easy to push on this case whereas a fake is not.i highly recommend this case. it fits like a glove. excellent condition have a lot of problems, can\\'t hear phone calls have to use loud speaker. very powerful phone good very sharp picture and display. the edge makes the picture looks 3d. the slippery glass face does not give me any problem about finger smudge as some people said on internet. however because the glass is slippery so you better get a protective cover not only to protect it but also prevent it from slipping out of your hand. great liked it thank you so much. it\\'s a pleasure to work with honest people. i got this phone turned it on and started setting it up within about 20 minites it shut off just get the 2nd version of this phone the screen is a little bigger and its a hell of a lot more reliable blackberry 8520 unlocked phone with 2 mp camera, bluetooth, wi-fi--international version with no warranty (black)excelente equipo, llego en perfecto estado con el cargador y cable usb. lo unico es que no viene con el idioma español, pero se actualiza el sotware y funciona perfectamente... lo recomiendo es muy bueno!!! very good phone except picture quality. 4g works fine in us. the cell phon never work well awesome for the price this was a replacement phone for my lost samsung note 3 which did not have insurance. i like apple because all of my things are apple. today while i was on my computer, my iphone rang into it. i love that everything communicates! i am still amazed and getting tuned in to this small iphone, it does so much! and it fits in my back pocket! can never have anything bad to say about apple. always reliable and does what i need had it for a couple of weeks now. looks like stock android, which is great. comes with everything you need, including a bumper case and screen protector, which is above and beyond. everything seems to load up pretty quickly, including websites. battery seems to last a couple of days at least if it\\'s not being used, which is great.pros:+ price! half the price of most unlocked phones.+ android 4.4 kit kat, and blu says they\\'ll be doing upgrades to lollipop in june, so basically the latest version of android.+ removable battery! thank god! it\\'s nice to be able to replace the battery yourself and give the phone to your kids. or just buy a bigger one without depending on someone to open the phone up. this is the way it should be. phones don\\'t need to be thinner than this anyways.+ bumper case, screen protector and even pretty comfortable earbuds with remote and mic are included.cons:- unfortunately, every emergency number is programmed in, including 123, which is my provider\\'s voicemail number. i found a way around it, but it\\'s a little annoying.- can\\'t find any alternative cases to purchase for it, but the included bumper case seems to be more than sufficient, so no biggie.- hardware buttons not back-lit. a little harder to use in the dark. can be remedied with software apps, however.- \"video-call\" camera seemed a little weak, but this will be used very little anyways. the normal camera, however, took some great photos.- voice on speakerphone didn\\'t sound so great. but again, probably won\\'t be used that much at all. using the phone normally sounds fine.to me, this is probably as complete as a budget smartphone as you can get. this might make me jump off of the ios bandwagon completely. battery life not great while i love samsung products, and galaxy\\'s this is only getting three stars because i can\\'t stand the at&t preloaded apps. they clutter up the phone and you can\\'t delete them. i love this phone! this is my second one.the seller did a great job being able to do a change of address for me. however when i received my phone and went to activate it, it already had a number and contacts in it, so it was not a \"new, unused phone\" like advertised. not happy about that part. the phone was too small - especially the keyboard. a +++ phone so far amazing! i have an iphone 6s, and this has paired smoothly without any downloads or qr code. i bought the \"silver plus,\" which has updated software. my calls are very clear. i can call out and receive calls. i can use the calendar, alarms (vibrate or chimes), i can also set the ringer to vibrate or ringtone or both. i can take pictures, record video and voice recordings, and the sound quality is great. i also added a 32g mini sd chip for storage, and the watch has a handy file manager that shows the album covers to all of music, once i select the song. the fm radio is terrific; the watch comes with a set of headphones that work with the watch, and the software interface is as nice as the \"brand\" name that this watch looks identical to. (sams#$% neo 2 wink) this smartwatch provides an excellent hands free way to receive calls. it has a quality build and the band is a very soft and flexible silicon-like rubber. my only complaint at all with this watch is that it easily synced all the contacts from my iphone, yet it didn\\'t transfer the numbers, only the names. still troubleshooting that. for the price, the look, and the fast phone functions on your wrist, this is a great buy and i am hoping it will have a decent lifespan. will update if anything odd or unfortunate happens. i am very surprised and pleased for now! :) goog love it the phone looks great but the home button does not work. i immediately contacted the seller and received no acknowledgement of my e-mail. i was able to adjust the settings on the phone to make it function. i am not satisfied with the seller at all. the htc evo 4g that was shipped to me is registered to the original owner with sprint and can\\'t be activated.i am trying to contact the original owner to find out if it was reported lost or stolen. i got this phone to replace my motorola razr 4g phone. yes...i went backwards. i broke my razr, and luckily had insurance that covered \\'stupid\\', so i was pleased to have it replaced...until i realized the insurance/phone company gave me a crappy refurbished razr which was worse than having nothing. thus i elected to buy this htc incredible to replace my replacement razr, as it was cheaper than paying the stupid insurance fee again. even for a 3g phone, i am very pleased with the speed, features, and smootheness of animation. i honestly can\\'t tell a huge difference in 3g vs. 4g, and honestly like it better...even though its a 2+ year old phone.i may have made a mistake when ordering though, because i did click on the link for \"9 new from $xx.xx\" and was expecting a new unused htc phone, as i paid the price listed for a new one. my phone did have obvious signs of use (meaning a few faint scuffs etc)...however i can\\'t be sure it wasn\\'t my mistake when ordering, so i still gave it 5 stars...just as a warning for others that may make the same mistake, make sure the description says new in box, unopened, etc if you are want a new phone. total lie .... i spent $293.00 on 2 of these phones that were supposedly unlocked. they were locked and i would have to pay a minimum of $50.00 per phone to unlock them. for that amount i went to t-mobile my carrier and bought 2 incredible phones. false advertising is all i have to say. excelente i think it is worth sharing my story so you can learn from my lessons. i had an \"inexpensive\" model g3 vigor phone from my cell provider. that in itself was a mistake, a low grade phone for $354.99. in addition i got the insurance for $11.00 per month. over the course of 18 months the phone slowly degraded: first bluetooth randomly disconnected from my car and bluetooth speaker, then the phone ran out of memory so i got an sd card for pictures and video, then calls started dropping, and performance kept degrading to the point where it took a few seconds to pull up the home screen and i had to keep closing apps to get it to perform at least reasonably. i finally had enough and made an insurance claim which was accepted but with a $25 deductible. the replacement phone was a slightly lesser model of phone: an \"escape 2\" which came with so much bloatware from my carrier i couldn\\'t even install my regular applications. this \"newer\" phone was slower than the original. the overall experience was quite frustrating. so i decided to do my homework and after much research of mid-grade phones i decided on the moto g4 plus.i picked up the top unlocked model available in july 2016: 64gb and 4gb ram bundled with a $50 amazon gift card for $299 so i essentially go the phone for $249. now that\\'s inexpensive! the phone has 54 gb available storage with 10gb reserved for the os. the octa-core processor and 4gb of ram make this baby scream: i keep several applications open at the same time and fly between them without pause. the camera has some very nice features for a phone at this price point perhaps the only desired feature would be image stabilization, but most phones with that feature start at twice the cost of this one. the pictures are much nicer than with my more expensive g3 vigor, and other phones i\\'ve used: s5, g3. the plus has a fingerprint reader which is awesome for unlocking the screen. after training the fingerprint reader i just touch my thumb on it and the phone instantly unlocks, wicked cool!there are two lacking of the g4 plus in my estimation: only 1080p video at a time when phones are starting to record 4k and pretty crummy internal speakers, they work great for phone calls but music sounds pretty tinny. to be fair i haven\\'t heard a phone whose speakers had me impressed, but i have heard better from other phones. that said, i use a bluetooth speaker for music which sounds great.as for insurance, i don\\'t think it\\'s worth the price when you consider the deductible. i will put $20 away each month ($11 of that comes from the $ i saved cancelling the crummy insurance plan.) by the end of 18 months i\\'ll have enough saved to replace the phone just received this watch yesterday and got it all set up. i really enjoy the look and feel of the watch. i do not find the size of the watch, at least as of yet, to be too large. it does not impinge my movement at it is very light, can hardly even tell i\\'m wearing it. the band is very comfortable and has plenty of different wrist size variability.as for the set up, make sure to scan the bar code that is programmed into the watch before pairing with bluetooth. i made this mistake last night and was confused as to why the bt notifier wasn\\'t pairing. so turn on the watch, scan the barcode, download the app on your phone, and then pair the phone and watch through bluetooth. once you do that i have gotten the phone calls, texting, and camera to work.one thing right off the bat i\\'m really disappointed about for this watch is the fact that i can\\'t change the clock interface or the background color of the home screen. it\\'s really not the end of the world, but i feel like this shouldn\\'t be too difficult just to allow users to change. oh well though.i did try to use the sleep monitor last night and it told me i slept poorly, but i don\\'t believe i did! something to play with more! i agree that the pedometer probably isn\\'t the most accurate. i am looking forward to get an extra micro card for memory and to put music on this watch. i will hopefully be using it to go on runs and not have to bring my phone.over all i definitely feel like for the cheap price of this watch i\\'m allowed to really see if i like this smart watch business. excelente producto todo excelente, el producto cumplió con todo lo publicado does not fit on iphone 5c. big features -love it, absolutely no complaints. well, i got the phone promptly, and it works fine. just a little startling that i can\\'t get a lot of the apps i had on my android phone, or that are available on i-phones. i imagine it\\'s fairly new technology, and more apps will come, but meanwhile i\\'m reverting to my old android, cracked screen and all. i may just fix the screen. i was disappointed that i missed a lot of the free sandwiches i could have gotten when wizards were winning . . . ! great phone. i gave it 3 stars because you need and adapter to put in the micro sim chip! also it should have more memory! accessing the internet is very slow! my samsung s4 is twice as fast with no delay accessing the internet! i ordered this phone according to the 4.5 and 5 star reviews. i purchased it in november 2015 and it is now december 2015 and the phone cannot hold a charge; dies easily. i have charged it overnight for about a month with no problems. then on christmas eve, i woke up and the first time since i have had the phone, it was dead and i could not get it turned on - it had died and unable to get it to charge. the only things i use my phone for, phone calls, texting, little internet usage when i want to look up something while on the road, and monitoring my webcams. the provider removed the battery - looked the phone over and had to charge it for me at their location. i left there and the same day in the evening, the phone was unable to keep charged up even after charging on the portable charger and through the wall socket. i am very disappointed that the phone cannot hold a charge. i do not recommend purchasing this phone. i would not give it any stars because the cell phone\\'s performance is extremely poor, but i had to give it at least 1 star. good evening, i wanted to know price and availability for phone battery c806036280t blu super camera studio c.thanks es necesario tener conectado el teléfono al pc para poder actualizar la agenda... teniendo una agenda de casi 700 contactos no es nada placentero tener que esperar que se carguen todos al sistema. awesome phone, everything perfect till now! phone looked good. good specs was going to use this for a vr project in the $100 range it was great. first off it shipped with a dead battery and in chinese, but i thought hey not a big deal. so i changed it to english and charged the battery. then i tried to download a program from the google store. after fighting with it for over an hour. i finally got an alert in the gmail app saying the phone did not support google services and to contact the manufacturer. it\\'s going back. so word to the wise if you need any google store software this phone isn\\'t going to work for you. amazing phone for a very low price my niece liked happy with this purchase. it did not appear \"new\" (as advertised) as it did not come with any original wrappings/box or even a semi sealed appearance. the charger that came with it didn\\'t work. it works, and its the phone as described but not quite as advertised the camera doesnt work. sometimes it doesnt open or when the camera open, it says cant save the pictures. plus is quite slow during us and sometimes just turn off. i dont like it. an excellent refurbished model, like new!! a+ and i would definitely buy again from this seller.phone works better than my last note3! all perfect!! amazing product!useful for many devices!despite that it\\'s designed for apple products this stand is useful for anyone with electronics! i used to have electronics strewn through out my house and every time i would try to look for a different one i would have to search all over my house! with this charging dock, i can choose what speed i want to plug my device into (how fast can it charge?) and then charge multiple devices at once! for the price the product is not bad but if my phone is in my pants pocket i sometimes lose connection. i have yet to understand the pace count and why i cannot convert it to miles or why the product software that i downloaded to my phone doesn\\'t convert or sync either. again, for the price it aint that bad. i like the phone. but the key pad is too small to use it. i don\\'t like nokia program. my ringtone play at the music player. i don\\'t know how nokia company program it. and i can\\'t delete their ringtone bs it is locked. next time i will choose windows mobile. i think this one superior to i phones 3 & 4 and possible 5. very nice phone with perfect size and good battery life. the screen is very responsive and smooth. that is the best i owned thus far. well worth the money. i use it in the state with t-mobile and overseas. good awful. the sim card reader doesn\\'t work so therefore i can\\'t get it on any mobile network. needs to be replaced. awesome phone, very minimalist love iy this smart watch is junk won\\'t charge & doesn\\'t sync with my nexus 5x very well. contact\\'s pull up random not what is on screen. could not get pedometer to work after 1 day read 20 steps before batt went dead. if i could give 0 star\\'s i would. don\\'t waste your money on it. it\\'s an ok phone not what i expected i need a copy of the purchase invoice this is the perfect phone to send to cuba for your love ones. they say its has the best reception ever. highly recommend. more that expect.... love that phone great smart phone for those of us that don\\'t need the latest and very expensive. not all of us need to buy an expensive plan, with the latest technology phone. i have a $10 a month plan with platinum tel, and don\\'t need a phone with all the bells and whistles, or the hi-tech games. i don\\'t use the browser on it very often either. but the gps and wifi work well, as well as the basics like calls and texts. when i am in an area where it is available it will pick up 4g and other higher modes. it is pretty speedy, and has kit kat 4.4.2. there is even space for 2 sim cards if you travel out of the usa. it has all the capability of the google features, including voice search, and connectivity to maps. only one con. it is not easy to see the screen in bright sun, but most are like that. so i get in the shade. using common sense, this phone is very adequate, and even beyond my expectations. it is terrific for a very affordable price, if you don\\'t have a business expense account. this is my second smart phone and i love it. it will even connect to my bluetooth system in my car. i highly recommend this great phone !! excelent love it! good excellent product met my expectations nice phone i absolutely loved the 5g way beyond my expectations for my 1st iphonethank you c7 everything you told me. worked perfectly i\\'m a sony phone user for years but the company lost me with this one as i will never buy sony phone ever again. this phone is terrible! i got a scratch on my screen the second day after a week my entire screen was scratched up. i dropped the phone once and it got bends and scratches all around the frame, that never happened with my old sony phones i would drop them multiple times and never had even a scratch. not only that whatever the phone is made out of sucks but also phone itself does not work well as it\\'s overheating constantly especially when you use camera. never again sony! have to move on to samsung. i had some reservations regarding this phone, but none of them panned out. the screen size and resolution is great, the phone isn\\'t too big in your hand or in your pocket, and it performs well. this phone is awesome. whether it\\'s the 5m waterproof rating, the flir, microsd support, the battery life, or the \"vanilla android\" experience, this phone is high quality (the unit has dual sim slots, but the second one is not enabled. i didn\\'t order it with this feature in mind, but it was a huge let-down to see the slot there only to find out i can\\'t use it! wtf, cat ?!)i don\\'t play games on my phone - i use it for work, so i can\\'t comment on any of that - but this phone is plenty fast for any of the apps i run day-in, day-out. the screen is a little smaller than i\\'m used to (i\\'m coming from a note 4), but it\\'s big enough. call quality is great. the speaker doesn\\'t seem any louder than a regular phone - this isn\\'t bad, but if you had a hard time hearing your old phone in a noisy environment, you\\'ll have a hard time hearing this one too. it\\'s a really rugged phone. it also comes with a screen protector - a nice touch! i\\'ll probably be replacing it with a tempered glass one in the future (i like the way they feel better), but it lets you keep the glass pristine right from the get-go.as for the flir - the feature that sets this phone apart - it\\'s an amazing tool. there\\'s one minor annoyance - you can\\'t turn off the \"flir\" logo which can sometimes get in the way and overall makes the output less useful - but if that\\'s the biggest complaint you\\'re doing all right. no matter what field you\\'re in there\\'s a use for the flir. if you point it at a breaker box the temperature will give you a good idea of what\\'s in use. you can see hot spots in equipment in a rack - useful for tweaking cooling solutions whether you\\'re it, av, or electrical. if you\\'re hvac it\\'s a great way to see if there\\'s a blocked coil in a radiator, or see the hotspots in a room - the list just goes on and on. yes, there are add-on solutions out there (flir one), and stand-alone flir devices - but they\\'re not nearly as convenient and durable as having it built into your phone.all in all, it\\'s a great device that can compete with any other phone on the market in \"regular stuff\", and then blow it out of the water with the special features (rugged / waterproof / flir). i can\\'t put this thing down! i had bought one of these phones about a year ago in india for use there. after returning to the usa i was able to use it here without problem after inserting the sim card from my consumer cellular phone into this phone and changing some settings. being happy with its performance i recently bought another one for my wife from amazon here in the usa. that one is also working great after using the sim card from her consumer cellular phone. i had a little problem setting up the second one but the consumer cellular technical assistants helped me do the settings correctly. we are now taking these phones with us for our vacation to new zealand. we are expecting that we should be able to use them there with locally purchased sim cards. i shall try to make another post in case i face any problems. its ok!the blue life xl is much better! not the pure! it never worked. this did not work since i got out of its box, unfortunately i knew that on coming to venezuela. i don\\'t return it because transportation is very expensive.if i could return at no cost i would do that, and buy my beloved nokia c3-01 after 60 days of use i find this phone meets all of my needs. it has no lag, sharp screen, is sturdy, charges quickly, lasts all day, takes sharp and proper photos, has no unwanted reboots, a nice loud speaker, and no failures of any kind. it is good, but i cannot find it\\'s international version because i didn\\'t find other languages from the phone. the rate of turning on is a little slow. i like the design, it is so ~~cool, and other girls always feel surprising because they always use the lovely ones. great for the price. so, my phone had some few issues from day one but knowing it was under warranty i kept it. it finally gets to the point i know the problem isn\\'t software and it\\'s hardware. i not only had to purchase a cheap second phone to use just so i could ship it i then get told they won\\'t f\\'in fix it. supposedly something came lose and they don\\'t care because as far as they are concerned it\\'s \"beyond economical repair\" . what is \"beyond economical repair\"? it\\'s whatever repair samsung decides it doesn\\'t want to do and jacks up the price to cover themselves. so a phone less than 6 months old is a paperweight.after this experience i will never be buying another samsung device and would recommend anyone to not do so. there customer service and warranty service is horrible. they even got the color wrong when they had the serial number!to update:1.) it was ber because it was not white. yet i ordered the charcoal black model and the back of the box w/ the same imei as the phone says \"black\".2.) amazon graciously is allowing me to return it. but this is not amazon\\'s problem and unfortunately they are having to handle samsung\\'s bs.3.) my moto x pure arrives tomorrow and i will be glad to be no longer using a samsung device. i purchased this product as an unlocked item. thereafter, i purchased another one on september 17 also as an unlocked item. one purchase was from the oem shop and the other one from dln enterprises. since both were shipped first to a cargo company in miami and then to my home in venezuela, i have no way of knowing which one came locked other than providing the sellers (i hope one will respond) with the imei and pin which is locked, as follows: imei: 358263018275487 pin: 557606bb. your assistance to solve this problem will be highly appreciated.best regards, have had the phone for a week now. very happy. really decent phone for the price. shipped on time. easy to get set up, it took about 10 min. didn\\'t come charged, so had to charge first to be used, but that was not a big deal. would recommend this phone if someone needed a reliable replacement phone. it is being used with a verizon contract sim and 32-gig micro sd. excelente this product was not what i expected, had to return the phone. its been a few weeks and so far so good! i absolutely love my titan e500! absolute bang for your buck! i\\'m anxiously awaiting the release of the 6.0 inch version!good hd cameras. great video quality. cam is pretty good in lower light environments; user friendly; good screen size. first off, i bought the phone as a replacement of my sony z3 dual.i\\'ve always been an android user so decided to stay with them. current flagship phones are too expensive and i don\\'t want to pay for it so looking into mid-tier phones or older flagship phones. i got an alert these were sold from amazon (not some 3rd party seller) for 350 so i jumped on it. i figured if it didn\\'t work out i could return for credit and buy the various other phones out there unlocked.pros+ got marshmallow update fairly quickly through autoloader (real easy, everyone should be able to do it)+ large battery to get me through the day+ big screen, curved sides help with holding the phone+ mostly stock android with a few tweaks that make life just a bit easier+ scrolling with the keyboard is literally the biggest thing for me+ on screen keyboard has the best word prediction solution i\\'ve ever seencons- a little flimsy, when i type on the onscreen keyboard there is a noticeable sound and bend or flex- wipe the front face of the phone might cause the slider to move- the back kind of feels weird and is plastic despite this being a flagship phonemiddle* keyboard, so it\\'s great to have a physical keyboard but it\\'s also a bit small. i don\\'t have large hands or fingers and i found it difficult to type using the keyboard. also to hit the top row it\\'s hard due to the slider portion just above it* wish it was usb c but that hasn\\'t been commonplace until recently.*mute button, i guess it\\'s good???overall a great phone for the price, the initial unlocked price was just too much. sorry if i dont write very well, i\\'m not in an english language country.so,nice phone, i\\'m very happy with this purchasepros:-excellent audio-good os-a lot of applications-good screen, confortable for videoscons:-battery life can be short, i recommend to install task killer to reduce the number of apps running all the time. and if you let them running the lag is annoying. really the task killer is for obligatory downloading.-the camera is bad, but if you want a camera, buy a camera.so, in final words, i love this phone :) very recommended as with a lot of reviews i\\'ve read, the phone was fine at first, then it overheated while charging, locked up and made a crackling sound several times before it finally died about 3 months after i got it.got no help from the seller and will never buy from them again arrived on time and just as it was described, a new u locked phone. was super simple to set up when i called cricket cs.this one replaced my lg phone. had an s3 in the past and was devestated when it stopped working, and this one picked right back up with where i had left off. had zero learning curve! very competent unit, i specially love the size and how it feels in the hand. my previous phone was a 5.1 inch unit, but somehow it just didn\\'t feel right.i\\'m finding a few functions that work ok but not quite with the way i would expect, but this is more of a software issue. the hot battery hasn\\'t been an issue with me. overall, i\\'m quite happy i switched from the samsung galaxy s6 edge. i\\'m now waiting in anticipation to the release of the 7.0 version (nougat), expected as early as next month.by the way, after reading all the reviews, i congratulate myself in not buying the latest compact version, xperia x. most everyone says the z5 compact is a better phone. it is a vodafone unlocked cellphone. not factory unlocked as advertised. with the actualization to android 5.02 the battery runs for a day and a half (much less than previously) and the led of notifications needs some help of an app to run properly. but arrived on time and apparently new and that\\'s what i\\'ve been looking for. great purchase, exactly how described!!! fast shipment !!! will buy from seller again!! thanks a bunch :) i am older and this is in very difficult to use. i need to get a new 4 g sim card to make it work correctly. with 3 g card it will work as a phone but it is not that smart either excelent... 100% positive... i like this cell-phone this case was for my wife. color is great. little thick but you get used to it because it protects well. it\\'s. a great watch does what they say it will. but i worry about the clasp...i know it works now but when the holes in the band get worn , is there another type of band to replace this one?i wear my watch everyday i love this watch!! i just don\\'t want to lose it. my mother is 80 years old and i purchased this item as it was to be unlocked and compatible with att. it comes with virtually no manual. the charger is something that will break easily as time goes on. once i inserted the sim card i could not get the phone to not say emergency only. it would not pick up the network at all. i searched and searched for details on this phone so that i could trouble shoot the issues and i could not find any sort of tutorial on this phone. the quality of the phone is that of a 23.00 phone...cheap. i have a computer background and have had numerous smart phones, basic phones and so on. i am pretty knowledgeable when it comes to troubleshooting anything technical. my sound advice is do not purchase this phone. if you do, please remember that old saying...you get what you pay for. great phone!!! love it. battery life is good. its about the size of the iphone 6 plus. love the camera and video recorder. display is great.do wish they would make accessories for figo atrium 5.5. i bought an iphone 6 plus case and modified it for power and volume buttons.would recommend it to others. it\\'s been 3 days since i got it, screen already showing problems, don\\'t know if it\\'s factory defect or they drop it right before sending it to me.... i am going to return it before it gets worse i bought this just in case i hated switching to an android. as it turns out i love the android. blackberry has been good to me over the years! sadly it was time to let you go. this phone was everything you would expect visually for a blackberry, however i never did use it. if you however need a blackberry i recommend this one. this purchase was a waste of money. a full battery charge lasts for about 30 minutes. and the phone is made so cheaply that it almost looks and feels like a toy. kinda crazy phone. lcd backlight turns on and off all day long, depleting battery. resets to default some of my personal settings every time i turn off the phone. u$10 would be a fair price for it! ok.. gracias nice awesome thanks love it good item exactly what was described! great buy! the product came in a fast & efficient manner, my only gripe is that someone from the company authorized a driver release without my knowledge. that could have been disastrous being it was a last minute birthday gift for my son. i also think you need a stylist in order to operate the menu flawlessly. good product! only problem i\\'m having is running outta of data space,.. me sad :( bought this phone over a year ago and it\\'s still doing great. it\\'s a great investment. i like this phone is a good one, the only thing i did not like about this phone is that it does not have flash and a front camara. all the rest works fine, good phone. very good excellent product..!!! i just ordered the iphone 4, it is my first time, so i\\'m really nervous about it, i\\'m hoping that it does not come in with defects all over it. i really need it to be good cuz it\\'s a present, just like i said before` i really am hoping for the best. it\\'s estimated to come on the 6th of december. so i\\'ll let you guys know more about it once it comes in. i bought his phone for an upgrade after i got tired of my iphone 5. i got this phone for my wife. it is a great upgrade from her iphone 4s as she doesn\\'t like bigger phones like the 6s or 6 plus. good product looks nice and seems simple to use haven\\'t gotten into it too much because i\\'ve been busy but doesn\\'t look cheap at all nice little basic phone, with a good battery life. holds up charge for more than a week with single charge. i have purchased several smart watches for my kids and this one is the best so far. will buy one more of this. the best case i\\'ve ever had! i keep it on all the time and it allows me to have all my important items, id, debit card, and some cash, without having to bring my wallet. not to mention the colors are awesome! it is also very durable; i have dropped it several times, on accident, and it has never popped open or broken at all. the only drawback i can think of is when my flash is on, the case makes pictures cloudy and grey because of the protrusion from the camera. however, i would highly recommend this case to everyone who appreciates convenience! fast delivery and as aspected. absolutely garbage. do not buy. a waste of money. dose not work when i need it. used all my mobile data even after i turned mobile data off. fantastic. this is my second otterbox for the same phone. it is rugged and durable. purchased two of these a month ago. so far so good. works excellent for the price overall this phone is not for me. it has a few great features though. way to expensive for what you get.it is too small for me and i don\\'t like not being able to delete the apps i do not use.i suggest watching the videos on youtube before you buy one. i love it 😈🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 the best phone i\\'ve had since my xperia z3! sony knows how to make a beautiful, speedy, and premium-looking device. if you\\'re looking for an android-based phone, look no further, the xperia z5 is the best i\\'ve had yet! i ordered this phone from dealfisher and it came as advertised. the phone is new and in a sealed box with all the accessories included. i was worried after some reviews and photos but the phone works wonderfully and is in factory new condition. very happy with this purchase and would recommend to a friend. the phone arrived on time and came with a very good case. it works perfectly and is an awesome phone for the price. couldn\\'t have asked for a better transaction. i have already recommended it to friends. this seller sold me a lemon. the phone dropped calls from day 1. i should have returned it but didn\\'t. i bought another phone about 5-6 months later after this phone died on me and cost me a lot of my contacts. i did drop my laptop bag on the phone and the screen cracked about 3 months in. the phone died about a month after that. but again the phone dropped more calls than any phone i have ever owned before the screen cracked. i would say every day i could count on it to drop anywhere from 2-10 calls depending on how much i was using the phone. very good product, i recommend it is working, however because it is unloced it would be nice if they either a: rooted the phone, or b: disabled the carrier updates. i keep getting an update notification for t-mobile, but am using it on another carrier. i loved it great iphone for a very good price excellent appearance, very good camera,easily operated. the white collour is beautiful!yes, i would recomend it to a friend good phone and charge the supplier, the only negative is that you can not change the menu language to spanish, i live in venezuela and i was disappointed that i could not change the menu language even so i use it and i\\'m getting used, with movistar line smoothly.buen telefono y responsable el proveedor, lo unico negativo es que no se le puede cambiar el lenguaje del menu a español, yo vivo en venezuela y me decepciono que no le pude cambiar el lenguaje del menu aun asi lo utilizo y me estoy acostumbrando, con linea movistar sin problemas. first apple ever. would never own anything else. so user friendly. the device came with scratches on the screen there was no password given so i cannot restore phone. the earbuds that came with device sounds as if you are using a.m. radio, the charger is loose and have to be wiggled around to charge and the biggest lie is saying it can get online but all i get is syntax error or cannot find a secure connection. the auto predict on the tex only works in chinese or japanese i am unsure which.this is a 2 star device only because you get video and picture capabilities which one can\\'t complain about the quality due to it being a $30 device, if these 2 items were not present i would rate it a -2 stars. i suggest one not to by this watch unless you just want one.ken xin da is a better product for around the same price!!this review was by cavanaugh j. long classy the phone\\'s loading time is generally slow and the camera quality is not good. may have just got bad one nice phone but having problems connecting to the web with my metro i am through with this phone since day one ive been putting up with its bulls***. ot has a number of issues, it would just reset on me for no reason mutlple time within like 5 minutes. then sometime it would just completly turn off for no reason and when i try to turn it on it doesnt. so i have to hold the power button and home button at the same time just so it can turn back on. and sometime that doesnt work and i have to wait for hours until it come back on. sometime i fear that it going to stop working completly.i dont know if the seller was aware with this issue but i am very upset with using it. i regret buying this phone from this seller and i regret not returning it because i thought all the problem would go away in a month and since you could only return product with in a month. i just wish that the seller will read this and offer me a new iphone but sadly i gotta put up with this phone until i have enough money to buy new iphone😪 what a waste if money. this was better than described, phone is like new, with barely visible scratches, no dents or serious damage, came with all accessories even when it did say that it only included was the phone i was wondering how fast and how easy this phone wouldt work,i\\'m very happy whti it so far.it is a great phone and everything on it works as it should.its a great buy for low budget i fell so in love with the first chsling z8 i got before that i got another one and this time i got the black color because i got the gold color the first time. it has the same features except for the color. it has 5.5 inches screen and it has a 5.1 android lollipop operating system. it is lightweight and is also thin. it is super easy to use and its response time is also fast. i like this phone because it has a smart wake feature so i don\\'t have to press the power button to wake it up. just double tap and it will wake the phone up. i also like the fact that it\\'s already unlocked so there is no need to pay to have it unlocked. it means that as soon as you get it, you can use it right away with any sim card of your choice. aside from that, it is also dual sim so you can use 2 sim cards from different carriers at the same time. that for me is very amazing. you don\\'t always find a phone with dual sim. as far as i know samsung and apple do not have it. so if you want to use 2 carriers but only want 1 phone then this smartphone is for you. it has all the basic features that a smartphone has so it\\'s a gem if you ask me. a gem that only costs $77.99.i got this product for free in exchanged for my honest review. i like it, good price, handle, everything app inside smart phone. i\\'ll admit, i was nervous purchasing this -- the price just seemed awful low and the seller is not prime. i waited till i had at least a week of use before rating, but after that and a bit more, i am pleasantly surprised and happy with the phone. it is clean and in very good condition as the seller description indicated. there were absolutely no issues with transferring my att account to this phone. product as described middle of the road phone battery life not so good when playing music and wifi sucks i like it, it\\'s working well. the htc inspire is not 4g on the t-mobile network and i can\\'t get the wifi-hotspot to work. i wish the sellers would have advised the buyers that the wifi hotspot doesn\\'t work on the t-mobile network and it is not 4g. the order said that i would get product one day and i got it way earlier than aniticipated! bf has not activated yet but i am excited about product. thanks.... great basic phone. ideal for elderly people who doesn\\'t need or want smart phones. small and beautiful phone at an excellente prize. i bought this phone originally for myself and the phone itself it great but it didn\\'t come with a new sim card so i had to buy a kit. that was my only qualm with this phone. the color is cute and the size is perfect; i love the new chargers, i got this phone after having an iphone 4 and the charger was always breaking on me so this was a nice change. as paranoid as i am about dropping iphones ( since i had a iphone 4) i did drop this a few times before i could get a case and was pleasantly surprised that the screen held up! one thing i dislike about apple products is the headphones, they are way too big for my ears and don\\'t have good connectivity so i never use them and i feel as if they\\'re going to waste! i did pass this phone onto my mother for an upgrade but i was also surprised when my mother ( a 50 year old non- tech savvy woman) came to me and told me she loved it as well! she found some of the apps to be too much but after she got the hang of how everything worked she really enjoyed it. she very much loves to use the facetime option. let me start by saying the look & feel of the phone was exceptional. i thought i had struck gold with this phone. but i was new to a android operating system ( i own a i-pad and love the simplicity of the o.s. and it provided me with a rude awakening of what was in store. the \"owners manual\" is one sheet of paper and it starts off with the premise that the \"as delivered\" configuration of the phone need not be explained or instructions need not be provided. hence the phone would only remain \"on\" for a few seconds and then promptly shut down. being \"new \" to android environment made my situation worse. i did reach \"tech support\" of my cell carrier who markets this phone hoping for some on-line assistance. the person told me i could clear any settings and put the phone in \"oem\" baseline configuration by a simultaneous manipulation of the power key and some other key which i cannot recall. doing this did not re-boot the phone as promised - but rather caused the screen to rapidly flash on and off - over and over. when i asked the tech support was this \"normal\" he replied that the phone had \"a total failure\" and was now totally useless. he implied that this was not the first time that this had occurred with this model of the blu phone. such a beautiful phone stuck with such poor user manual. so far, a great phone. i did a lot of research when deciding on a new phone in this price range. i listen to a lot of music on the run and the tipping point in favor of the idol 3, for me, was the front facing stereo speakers.i\\'ve had the phone for a few days now, and i\\'m very impressed with it. the user interface is pretty much stock lollipop, which i really appreciate. there is very little bloatware/shovelware taking up memory and what there is can be easily removed. the camera is average and takes decent pictures under the right conditions. bluetooth paired up with all my devices, even the more finicky devices that have given me fits in the past. call quality is really good and the voices are clear on both ends. signal reception has been the same as my old phone and i have had no issues connecting to the network. wifi connections are as expected and i have had no issues.i dropped in a 128gb micro sd card and it is working as expected. i haven\\'t had a chance to test out the nfc connection, but it\\'s nice to have this capability.the real shocker is the sound quality. the front facing stereo speakers are really impressive. they are loud and you can crank it up with no distortion. everyone i\\'ve demo\\'ed this for has had the same reaction, \"whoa, that is impressive\". are you going to replace your home sound system? of course not, but you get some pretty big sound from some pretty small speakers. the other surprise was from the included ear buds. i wasn\\'t expecting much, but they sound pretty good for being included in the box. they have flat, no tangle cables and include different size ear pieces. they are a little flat sounding in the mid range, but not objectionably so. they won\\'t replace my more expensive ear buds, but if these were the only ones i had, i\\'m not sure i would be that quick to replace them. i definitely won\\'t be throwing these out.all in all i am very happy with this phone. it has great features and the sounds is incredible. on top of all that it functions well as a phone. in my opinion, this is a good value for the money. excelente this mobile is exceptionally good with all it\\'s features and performance.camera quality is excellent with 13 mp and 5 mp. i just don\\'t carry my digital camera after getting this mobile as the pictures are clear.audio is good.dual sim option is another feature which attracted me towards this mobile. i was using 2 mobiles and need to get rid of one s it is difficult to maintain 2 mobiles. and this one, as advertised, is working well with 2 sim cards / networks.it\\'s been few months now i started using this mobile and didn\\'t find any issues with it till date.happy that i own a fantastic mobile for a decent price.definitely recommended. phone does not work with at&t i purchased it for a friend of mine in jamaica. i called him frantically all day trying to reach him . i couldn\\'t until 2 days later he called me to say the was dead and would not turn on. it eventually did. but still has a tendency to freeze. would not recommend. for $50. maybe. very nice my brother like it super fast shipping. great phone for the money! amazing watch and exactly its purpose.. setup was really hard, i\\'ve updated the firmware but it kept sending me back wrong password. i\\'ve spent a full day trying using the last 4 digits of the imei written on the back side of the watch..when i\\'ve tried to use 0000 as the default password.. guess what?!! it worked :)all instructions worked fine after this and the watch was performing very well and my 6 years old kid was amazed.. that was releifing as i\\'m based in egypt it would be hard for me to replace it :)after 1 day.. i can recommend this watch to anyone who wants to stay connected with their young kids. and the gps works perfectly..just wanted to share with you all the password trick i\\'ve had as it might work with others.. didnt work....the seller took it back with no questions...i will buy new next time! great replacement for my damaged phone. can\\'t believe the price of this great product!!!! love it!!! they should unblock short distance texting. great phone, works perfectly. as an owner of the original galaxy note, let me just start by saying most of the issues or \"annoyances\" felt in version 1 have been ironed out in version 2.everything is better with the note 2. the speed of this thing is awesome. windows fly open with easy and smoothness, faster screen switching and all around a more solid feel in the operating system. it is hard to describe. i highly recommend just playing with one at the stores and you will instantly feel its awesomeness.love the extra features, multi-tasking (although i hope future versions support all apps), better s note capabilities and touch/feel. this thing takes stunning photos and videos. love all the new photo add-ons....voice activating the shot by saying \"cheese!\" is killer. photo buffs will love all the new android 4.1 features.everything shown on the screen is literally breathtaking. all my friends are jealous when i show it to them. take that tiny iphone! battery life is awesome, my biggest complaint regarding the note 1.note: rooting! i rooted my phone, but user beware. if you root this phone, mine stopped getting updates via kies and the phone\\'s update system. i had to get download of the latest international firmwares, and install it manually. not hard, and ensures you are always up to date. if doing this, make sure you write down your current baseband and build number in settings/about device section and get the latest available build that matches the country code. google it. i highly recommend backing up your current rom/firmware if you do any rooting.love the phone....wish it was cheaper, but well worth the money and upgrade from the note 1. highly recommend it! dropped my 6plus on my hard tile floor. the screen didn\\'t break! that\\'s 5 stars in my book. when i didn\\'t have an otterbox case & i dropped my phone only about 2 feet from the floor the whole thing shattered. this case is great. just what i expected after reading many of the previous reviews...good product, got it on time...happy with it good experience.. loved it. activated fine with no issues. i just bought a pin code online for 9.99. using it in my sam c5 alarm. lo compre y fue entregado al currier el dia estipulado.... aun no lo tengo en mis manos, es decir no ha llegado a mi pais. porq mi currier es un poco lento. cuando llegue el telefono les digo que tal es. uupdate 2/28/16. phone is a fraud. called samsung themselbes and the imei is not regisyered at all, no insurance, no warranty ability. update 2/11/16 phone is freezing daily, not functioning. i don\\'t know when i can get back home to retrieve this piece of trash. // absolutely useless as a cell phone. great pics, looks pretty. completely failes in its primary roll as a cell phone for communication. tested on at&t and t-mobile. compared to two different oneplus one phones side by side and same service. the dbm levels are a joke. phone cuts out constantly where the oneplus one has at least 3/4 bars... this phone does \"connect\" to lte on both t-mobile and at&t once you simply program in the correct apn settings..... it\\'s the signal that is bad / have to be returned... i would have given this baby a 5 stars if it wasn\\'t for the battery life. it goes down at an incredible rate and definitely needs to be charged once a day if you\\'re a heavy user.on the flip side this thing is well built, does anything that other smartphones can do, possibly more and it doesn\\'t dry out my wallet.i think the camera images can be a bit better for an 8mp camera but maybe i just havent found the right app yet.recently installed avp the game, works fine. this phone ran about every i i threw at it thus far and i\\'m an appaholic :)update : 12th july 2013still going strong. i still hate the battery life of this phone but the performance is outstanding.there isn\\'t a person that i\\'ve shown this phone to that wasn\\'t impressed and i\\'m not just saying that. i will definitely be buying another one for my spouse for the holidays. love iy this phones description does not tell you it\\'s only a 2g phone. and trying to get sim card in is a joke. worst reception ever. no one could hear me or it was always garbled. try again polaroid. love it it\\'s working fine and i am happy for the phone condition. no problem!!! thanks you great watch for the money, battery lasts 3 days on a charge. only would like to have been able to convert from metric to us measurements and it being water resistant. yes product wasn\\'t unlocked as stated in the description. thank you! i love my new phone!! it works great. the cord was faulty though :/ but i replaced it so no big deal. bought this to replace my samsung 4... much better phone....... would suggest this one...... lovely it was good, my brother loves it. within one month phone stop working i bought this phone in february (sold by and shipped by amazon); on opening the box, i noticed that it was a motorola france unit but aside from having to use an adapter on the charger, there were no issues and i enjoyed using the phone until october. suddenly the phone kept rebooting every 5 minutes. i checked online and found others with the same issues but no solution. i contacted motorola(usa)who advised me that this was a french phone and i should contact motorola france! well i contacted amazon instead and they emailed me the same day saying that a new phone was being priority shipped to me and all i had to do was print out their return label which they emailed me and ship the old phone back..it was the most amazing customer service i have come across. if more companies were like this, life would be so much less stressful. it does state no warranty on the product description but this did not stop amazon from doing the right thing. i just got the phone and i thought that i can set up russian language version. but there\\'s only few languages. and i will return phone back. don\\'t buy.bought this for my husband bout 3 months ago,and his phone is all messed up like the phone keeps restarting and the screen turns blue u can\\'t do any thing on it, and can\\'t return it or replace cause return day is up :/pay the extra money for a phone. nice compact design, good value excellent this smart went out of functioning 1.5 month ago, i cant recharged anymore, a total disaster $39.00 to the water less than 3 months for nothing i do not recommend this product to nobody, totally unsatisfied, no way. i don\\'t kwow 5 starts for this phone is different version.the processor is 1.9 not 2.7 octacore. because is international version and no warranty. just as expected. the phone is not worth $5 the camera is really bad and the phone with no extra apps is really slow and using data from the provider is such a hassle to figure out .and so many other things.bottom line dont buy this phone. it is really cute and durable. i love it! my son absolutely loves this phone! now i want one to go with my ipads, lol! to be honest i was very disappointed, the phone box was opened and to me the phone did not look new. i had no time to return it berceuse it was a gift for somebody! came in very good condition (new) as it says in the publication recommend a very good article. was sealed, brought all their accessories and released. in venezuela served to perfection. brings additional memory 2gb micro sd this is my second posh and my second smartphone. i upgraded because i wanted gps. my sister is going to take my old pegasus which is still functioning fine. i love my titan, definately a crisper display and camera, but most of all it is super fast. i have to get my data working on it though. i don\\'t think it is the phone, i think it is something with configuring and setting it up. had to do something special with the pegasus too to get it set up. chatting now with my carrier to see if they can help me. it is a very large screen, so i am going to gift my asus tablet to someone as i really don\\'t need it anymore. this phone is faster than my tablet. funny story with this one. my first phone was stolen off my porch so i had to report it stolen and buy another replacement then once i got my replacement phone my son decided it needed a cranberry juice bath before i even had a chance to activated it. so needless to say it was no good anymore. i put in a drawer a year later i took it out and plugged it in to see what would happen and to my surprise it started to charge, and i have been using it ever since. even after being soaked in juice and not working for forever it is working now and i love it. absolutely no complaints excellent ... i recommend it! good price, good product! once the battery drained, it was impossible to recharge it! waste of time and money!! i got mine refurbished first, they sent me a wrong color, locked mobile. but after i returned it and got the right one... boy is it beautiful! i love it. it\\'s quick, smooth and different :d i\\'d buy it again, never disappointed by nokia... or microsoft or whatever. nice phone, works well good case. color as expected this is the worst phone ever simply the worst!!!!!!! i was worried about this phone but now i am happy i\\'m using this phone almost 4-5 month it\\'s really good service everything is good but it\\'s took little long time to get full charge anyway it\\'s great phone i\\'m happy excellent condition hopefully it\\'s going like that i hope bought for my daughter and she loves it. loves the size and features. very satisfied with the purchase. good phone, functional for my 12 year old daughter. excellent condition. was very pleased. very fine! i like this charger. it\\'s small so easy to carry around. it only gives you one full charge which is fine. i highly recommend it. i used to have the bigger version which gave you 4 full charges but this one is just as great! this j5 is unlocked for south central and na-only is not a dual sim, just a single micro-sim slot; if purchased from seller (lifeline786). the stand-alone second micro-sim slot is not even manufactured, just looks like an etched in plastic image of a sim slot. so for those who are wanting both sim slots manufactured and available to use look elsewhere. fyi: works with gsm band only (like att & tmobile, not verizon). if the stand-alone micro-sim was programmed to accept international sims then i\\'m sure you will not be able to have someone else unlock the phone to have it use international sims at all?! so those of you who want to be able to switch between both na and international sims (or want to switch between two mobile accounts from the same provider or switch between two different providers like att and tmobile) without having to switch sim cards might want to look elsewhere.(product review)cons: samsung are making their phones lighter now by using cheap plastic casing; as a result no impact resistant at all, so buy a case to protect it from drops. i guarantee the phone will break from the first drop!pros: internally advancements matches what is stated in the phone\\'s specs. lives up to the 41 mp. takes excellent photos. not fond of the windows 8 menu - too hard to find things, but i bought it for the camera, not windows 8 (which sucks on any device). to start the phone was very easy to set up. i\\'m rocking on some tunes right now as i\\'m writing this review. i dropped a 4gig card in it and began downloading albums, no problem very simple if you follow the included instructions. the phone does lag at times but this has not been a major issue. texting, mms, and phone calls all work like any other phone. i read cnn news daily on the phone which works great for me. overall for me this was a great buy. the phone works with the new battery but has to be restarted every couple of days because it says it can\\'t read the sim card. but it\\'s fine other than that. . excellent excelent ítem. love it shipped perfectly. using flawlessly for months on end. would suggest buying a sim card with it unless you live close to a spring store, i had to make three trips to get it working properly. however, that isn\\'t the buyer\\'s fault, sprint just has a s***ty way to do everything. 10/10 absulutly great phone for great price, not worse than galaxy s5 at all! works perfect, just what i needed. bought it for $79 promo and worths every penny. first i bought this brand (studio c )for my 10 year old child and works great, then i decided to buy one for me. fully recomended. arrived as promised. phone has worked great. very satisfied about my order will get more stuff from amazon excelente i loved this phone. we had some good times. it worked great. the camera was amazing. it broke. smashed. was destroyed. here\\'s hoping i can get the screen fixed. but amazing phone. really great for the price. just got my phone in the mail yesterday. i have not one complaint so far. the phone is excellent condition. works great and was super easy to set up. package was delivered promptly and came within the time frame i was given. currently writing this review on the purchased device. if necessary i would definitely purchase again!! thanks amazon!! great actually the phone is very good and i love it. i would say it is perfect deal to have this nokia phone with these specifications. the phone would not allow me to upload music.. this is my second order and i received the phones in excellent condition both times. thank you again. great phone, much better than expected i bought this phone for my niece who lives in iran. and it has been almost a year since i purchased this phone for her and every time i talk with her, she mentions who she loves this phone. i asked her if it was easy to get it going (since it is an unlocked phone) with an iranian carrier and she said it was extremely easy and quick. there were no problems what so ever.so based on her comments, i am happy with the purchase. great phone for the price, and it works with all networks. working fine everything is good. the minor issue is if you use camera or play games for a long time the phone gets heated. gr8 love it i purchased this phone, which arrived new and everything in order. however it came with a verizon sim card, which had me curios.my challenge is that i inserted a local sim card and i keep getting the message \"insert sim\", mind you the sim works in my other phone so i know its not the sim.can someone assist with this challenge and suggest any necessary changes i can possibly make......though i was skeptical to purchase initially, i did my research before i did, and was a bit more confident. spend the extra money and buy a better phone. this one constantly freezes up when you use the internet. not a that great a phone as i was expecting. it works well but could be a lot better. i\\'m disappointed that samsung leads it\\'s name to such a shabby smartphone brand. spend the extra money and buy a galaxy s4, s5, or s6! the lime color is more a yellow with very green undertones. good not duos!!! beware. i had try twice to get the galaxy s5 neo duos but both times i received single sim version and had to return them.i really don\\'t know why they advertise an item that is not what it should be. touch screen didn\\'t work, we have sent it back and waiting for a new one to return. bought this phone and it was big and bright, very fun from the start. i love windows phones and their os better then android, so i knew what i was getting into with the app problem and expected it when i picked this phone out. about for months in, thus phone had trouble charging, it just wouldn\\'t when i plugged it in. then it started acting right again for a month, then it started happening again with the charging, i rebooted it to try a \"troubleshoot\", and when i went to turn it back on it wouldn\\'t, gave me a blue screen. now it\\'s my toddlers toy. haven\\'t even owned it a year and it\\'s already a paper weight. i usually don\\'t write reviews, and this might not happen to the next person, but i wanted to give my experience so hopefully it would help someone i liked the phone but unfortunately i had to ship it back due to me not being able to switch to sprint service. everything else about the phone is great including the appearance and performance of the phone. was everything my daughter wanted. the celphone is too slow\\'. you have no idea how i loved this phone and this was second one. the batter had exceptional life, easy to use, great pictures. you name it, it had it. both phones out no where just cut of. one cut off before the thirty day period and the other afterwards. twice is enough. if this is the same company who make the electronic cigarettes, maybe they should stick to making those. however, if they can significantly improve this phone, i would buy again. highly recommended this shop! i send my phone brand new and details that is the opposite of the store citycellular to buy 2 phones and details were i give it an outstanding across the board love this phone! came highly recommended. have replaced a chip and will be using it more soon.thanks. i am planning on purchasing another as gift. awesome. the phone is amazing a and great value. worked fine with regard to pics and apps and outlook. however, last week the phone literally caught fire and was destroyed. a very dangerous situation made better only b/c i was near a sink when the battery began to smoke and then melted into my phone. i feel the extended life 3000 mah 72hour battery was to blame as it\\'s very powerful and one glitch lead to a really dangerous issue. the phone is melted and the battery burned an orange burn hole in my sink. thank god it was not in my pocket. no contract, no data plan! yes! i just wanted a phone to text message with. i love the qwerty board! and there is a flash on the camera! i love this phone much more than my old one. however, the phone tends to restart, and pocket dial. sometimes it drops calls.a the whole thing was a terrible experience. while i\\'ve only had this a few days, so far it\\'s far better than i expected. a few notes about some issues users report.1. the phone as of 2016-05-18 did not work on metropcs, so save your time, at least not in my area. t-mobile and att are fine. i believe some of the entries on amazon say it works on metropcs, that\\'s incorrect. it will work on any network that accepts unlocked gsm phones.2. the usb charger is not hard to work around, all you have to do is take a standard length microusb plug, take a hardware store razor blade, and slice away at an angle from the plastic connector down to the metal part, it\\'s really not difficult, and there\\'s no need to worry about having the slightly longer included cable, i just cut away at about a 45 degree angle and a standard cable fit fine. the case is at a slight angle where the connector meets the body, so that side can be cut away slightly more than the other. without this cable mod, the connection was erratic using a standard usb cable, with it, it\\'s fine.3. standby battery life is quite good, but when you use it for anything, the battery drains fast, but that\\'s why it only weighs 52 grams, you can\\'t expect a tiny battery to have a long life, that\\'s not realistic.this little phone is amazing, they\\'ve actually managed to cram a full android smart phone onto the device. typing on it is delicate since the key icons are so tiny, but you actually get the hang of it unless you have thicker fingers.in terms of size, this phone is literally about the same size as just the top lid part of an old flip phone i have.i can\\'t think of a better phone for things like backpacking where you need to have a phone for rides etc, and for me, i prefer this small size, i almost never carry my full sized smart phone because i just don\\'t like that size.i won\\'t know for a year how durable this thing actually is, but honestly, at the price, i don\\'t even care if it fails, you can buy 12 of these for every galaxy or iphone you buy, and they aren\\'t nearly as adorable. it was great not bad for an 8gb phone, i have my music on one drive it come with the case and screen protector 100% unlocked still waiting for windows 10 phone upgrade the phone is windows 8.1 it don\\'t work excellent! it works perfectly fine and is exactly what we reed on the descrption. thanks for your honesty. is in the best conditions. the deliver was on time. nothing bad to say. thank you very much. just got it in the mail today and i love it! honestly feels like i paid $900 for this phone. quality is all there and the screen and sound (dolby digital) don\\'t get me started. huge upgrade from my nexus 6. love it! the product works amazing. but there are some troubles when you update some software. i had used the burst model for 4 years. the discover edition is amazing. but, the user must keep away from the updated. bought this lenovo a916 and was excited over the specs and the price. gsm signal drops, poor reception. not satisfied with the product and just gave it away. hangs very often. even simple texting does not work without freezing. very disappointed. had to go back to my old phone. i received this today (as a present) and could not be happier. the phone is full featured, got the kit kat update, and has plenty of features to make it work for you. it is the first android phone that i can say is really decent. big screen, responsive touch, battery seems decent, and has everything i could have hoped for. finding cases is a challenge, there are no otter box defenders for this. but the phone is decent and worth every penny considering how much a similar sized and featured phone would cost from other manufacturers. this has the nicest screen of any phone in the at&t store. emoticons, picture messaging, etc. all work from the native messaging app as though i was using an iphone.....very nice. you won\\'t be disappointed if you are looking for a nice andoid phone that is large, but works well.....and has the nicest screen of any of them.update: i have been using this for about 3 weeks now, and am happy with it. i had a problem with phone calls cutting off, and was about to return it, but i realized the app killer function (built-in) was killing apps every hour and it must have been killing off my phone calls. that said, i turned this off, and have not had any issues since. if you go to the android.com/filetransfer site, you can transfer media from a mac to this phone. i have a windows computer, but didn\\'t have luck synchronizing things with that. the mac however, with this app for mac, lets you transfer music from itunes, pictures, etc. from your mac to this phone. a very nice feature that didn\\'t work well on other android phones i had tried. the lg interface does everything i would want it to do. i wanted reminder tones for notifications on text messages, and lg\\'s native message app has this. it also has a little counter on the app icon that tells you how many messages you have in there that are unread. it also has a great browser that lets you see pages without pinching and zooming; the pages just display at the right size most of the time. native android doesn\\'t have features in it that i consider mandatory, like notification reminders - but lg\\'s version for this phone does have that. the experience on lg\\'s version of android is really good - similar to an iphone that i was using.the only thing i can say that has been frustrating is that every once in awhile, there are times things slow down. in particular, i have not had any of these until one day i went to reply to an email - something i don\\'t normally do from my phone. at that moment, i saw it struggle and slow down. but eventually it caught up and it wasn\\'t that big of a problem. was happening when i was in a poor signal area, which might have been more of the problem.everything else has been good. bought a cradle charger for a spare battery, along with a spare battery, and can carry it with me if i\\'m going to be nervous about not being able to charge while i\\'m out. if you disable apps you don\\'t need/use (for me things like google music, news, books, all of the at&t apps, etc.) you can really conserve battery. i can get through a day with plenty of battery left, while having light to moderate use. i keep the screen on auto and set the max brightness baseline to 70%. the biggest use of the battery is the screen, and if you want to enjoy it at 100% (which is really too bright) the battery will go out much more quickly. then again, the screen is so nice, you sometimes want to fully enjoy that beautiful screen so you just leave it plugged into a battery pack or something while you play a game, if you want to keep your battery charged while you play.this is a really nice phone. while the lg g3 just came out and is likely a nice upgrade to this, this does everything i need for a reasonable price. with phone prices now being \"full price\" one way or another, i really paused when thinking about buying a \"new\" one. $30/month x 26 months is a long term commitment, for a phone. basically it is the cost of a nice laptop, for a phone. and while they are a mini-computer, with a phone, i can\\'t come to deal with that kind of pricing. this phone, as a refurb, has not been a disappointment and saved more than 1/2 over buying a newer, new phone. i get 4g lte (at&t) and 4g without fail. i have not gotten 3g, but then i haven\\'t travelled to an area that doesn\\'t have 4g/lte. hotspot feature works great and doesn\\'t use endless amounts of battery either. this is the best iphone i have ever purchased. i\\'m very pleased great product. i love it because i can store more than one card. not too bulky. :) received phone in a speedy fashion and am very happy that i got this phone. works great. did exactly what i wanted it to do. at work or anywhere i don\\'t want to carry my phone i just insert the sim card from my at&t android phone and the watch performs just like a phone. easy to use. bought one for my son. works great phone was ok, but it came in an s3 box, battery didn\\'t work and didn\\'t come with headphones. overall phone works ok. i like all the features of this phone. the only downside is that the configuration and use of the phone is not as intuitive as it should be. i just got this phone it said new lmao it been use more then my old phone oh an said it was un lock not true so dont waste your time an cash ..........junk junk junk .... the 4g lte sim card has a code on it, so you cant reset the phone with out the puk code. you can here it ring but you can\\'t talk on it to low and i don\\'t. use mind now this is certainly value for money. this reasonable phone has a lot of the specifications of a more expensive smartphone. added bonus was that it came with earphones, a case and a protective glass. well worth it. fast delivery. the widely loves it. good condition love the style and color. awesome phone!! i would certainly buy it once again only if they would have future android updates but they don\\'t. besides that is an amazing phone. purchased for traveling abroad to use with foreign sim cards can\\'t wait to try good phone good price arrived in perfect condition; no problem setting up and works like it\\'s brand new. buying a used phone can be a scary proposition, but this seller is honest/safe. do nt buy it, is a waste of money. avg antivirus warned some preloaded apps contain malware. has second characters i n chinese cannot delete. will not play youtube after downloading new app from google play. have to press keys hard. spell check overides abbreviations and short cuts. it is the worst cell phone i have. i switched to my samsung mega. will buy a galaxy 6 edge. lenovo computers and tablets which have owned work excellent. their phone is awful, i wish i could return it. this is a foreign device not from america. strange charger and device is not in english. if your american i wouldn\\'t buy. it doesn\\'t work out of network i will be honest about this device i did not like it at first and i wanted to sell it in the next hr after opening it not because it was messed up or the packaging was destroyed because tbh the package and the device is and was flawless (for the device of course lol) but after i downloaded tons of apps (well not tons but a lot more then i had on my last phone) i love this phone. its fast and its definitely slim. however when i go to go on facebook i cant go live and on top of that i cant do the emojis like the heart button for the like etc please bring back that !! this item was purchased for someone who had a similar one years ago and wanted one just like it again. it is an upgraded version and the person is very pleased with the phone. grand daughter loves it! we live in costa rica and the phone works very well here. it is compact, light weight and easy to use. would recommend it to everyone. i am not such an apple fan but this phone grew on me so quickly that i have been trying to buy it for a while. i bought this for someone but i would love to get one for myself, that is how much i value this particular phone the best ordered this iphone 5c as a gift. out of the box it was locked with a indiana phone number. i brought it to an apple store, where they found the phone defective. luckily they gave me a brand new phone without a hassle. very disappointed in this phone.. this will be my 3rd replacement this this time the power switch. i also sent dealer and amazon a return request about 2 weeks ago no word. ill try again. the buttons are very poorly located. if you try adjusting volume you hit power button or the button on lower right side. i think its for camera function of of some kind. oh yeah no instruction manual. i had to download it. still haven\\'t printed it out because the thing keeps acting up.115-4866059-3015469 how can u see videos on the phone i go on facebook try to look at a video and it just loads and loads but dosent show any thing its a used phone in perfect conditions works like it was new the best investment that i have made on a phone great! just what i wanted light scratches, works well and the best phone i had so far ... very good design, elegant, comfortable congratulations to the people of nokia thousand points just love ... (recomendable 100% ) the phone did not recognize my sim cards immediately. i contacted the seller who reassured me that the phone was indeed factory unlocked. i kept trying and after day three is when it recognized them. also the charger came without the the adaptor. it\\'s always so hard for me to purchase electronics online, but the phone works now however the charge runs down by midday every day. i have to keep it constantly charged. never read abt this when doing my research nice phone however gps did not work, wifi would not stay connected and my sim could not be found at times. i was in contact with posh to try to fix the product. the fix did not work. hola. soy de venezuela. me encanta este equipo lo puedo usar con cualquiera operadora y tiene todas sus funciones muy practicas.comprenlo...jeje al igual que cualquier equipo nokia. excelente marca. so far so good. thank you i like the fact that it came with a charger and the ear phones but the screen was slightly lifted at the top. also it freezes up sometimes partially probably because of that. i can say other than that it is a good phone. 100% is recommended phone have lots of dents that i didnt expect phone came prompt, bought it for someone else. the back is glossy so beware touching the back. i got fingerprints on the back. my sister was expecting a greater camera but its really good for the price. i recommend it to others. i have problem with my cell the touch not function . excellent that\\'s all i can say for my first purchase through amazon i must say i was very pleased with my otterbox. i will be doing a lot more business from amazon great phone i\\'m happy with this one over the x performance. the only thing is i only get 4g on t-mobile but i love this device. this is the one flagship that allow you to put your app on the sd card big update. i have the blue one; my husband has the orange one. i have to say; buyer beware if you are after a certain color! :) these are day glo bright. his orange phone, which looks nice and muted in the picture online, arrived as hunting-vest orange. it.. is.. so.. bright. my phone is more of a robin\\'s egg blue, but that\\'s ok. fortunately my husband didn\\'t mind is day-glo phone! his response was, \"well, at least i can see where i put it.\"for the hands-on usage... it\\'s ok, but it has its quirks. for some reason, it hesitates what seems like forever after i select the \"text\" app and try to send a message. i have to continuously tap my finger on the \"type text message\" box to get it to respond.hearing on it isn\\'t the best; i have the in-call volume all the way up and sometimes have trouble hearing my calls unless i\\'m in a quiet area. if you\\'re in an area any louder than a grocery store (or watching a movie for example), you may have some trouble. it has a great loud ringtone though!i wish i could completely turn off vibration. i still get a vibration when i receive a text or when the phone is in-call and it \"connects\" to the number you dialed; even though i have vibration and haptic feedback turned off. strange. this might be user error, but their manual doesn\\'t specify very clearly if there is a way to completely turn off all vibration. i\\'m not too bothered by it as i\\'m just using this strictly as a mobile phone and not an entertainment device. if it goes off once in a while, i won\\'t die. i don\\'t have battery/space hog apps such as facebook installed, so my battery life is very good. it can last two days before i have to charge it.the screen is hard to see sometimes. you have to angle it \"this way\" or \"that way\" depending on what you\\'re trying to do.all in all, it\\'s a solid phone and it\\'s good for the price. i don\\'t make many calls, mainly just use it for texting. once i find another phone that\\'s a little more user friendly with more options, this phone will be my trusty back-up device! muy bueno. best phone ive recieved. looked brand new with very few scratches! great phone love it the sender got this phone to me in a nice amount of time but the phone does not have an updated system at all. even the marketplace is out dated. the phone was not worth it. full hd, super funny to draw and take notes. iphone arrive at the time completely new , but box was open , i mean it came with an plastic cover like the new one from apple but it was obviously open previously because inside the phone there was a sim card , i was not surprised because i read that before in the other comments , yesterday my phone was inhibited for minutes , ive read thats normal un iphone 7 plus , so im happy for the fast delivery but kinda worry for the product very good, excelent cell phones! great performance and a pocket size. i love it. you will. great! wasn\\'t what i was expecting phone is perfect, works great on tmobile service. love the flash on the front camera. awesome, gift. thanks. very happy with the product so far. camera is a little slow to focus. excellent battery life. i bought the cell phone for my sister and she saids is perfect. i love it! haven\\'t use it.hopefully works as posted on the website.its a gift for someone and will be given by february. buenisimo i e tryed different plans doesn\\'t work waisted like 300 bucks on it although there is no sim card needle in the package, the product is awesome. thanks. this is the second one of this phone that i buy!! i think is just amazing!! so fast and with super great camera!! this product is very nice for the price but i really don,t know if this is a china version because when i open it first there were chinese writings at the beginning and some of the things i try to access is in chinese language. it have a lot of great features so i hope it work well like my older version i already bought this phone(samsung note 4 verizon) but i want unlock it with code by bying it is possible? does everything i want a cell phone to do and it came packaged in original box and looked like it was never used. the 5 stars applied to aperture shots. i bought this phone primarily because of leica and heard good thing about huawei quality product. both are not disappointed . the picture of the phone not really justified how well made of this product until you unboxed it and hold it on your hand. the selfie camera comes with native beauty photo mode which pretty much can do a lot of cool thing to your face and body, not that i ever going to use it. to my surprise it already installed with android 6. the low end spec strangely the only one that support nfc, another reason i chose this model besides the lowest price. it could be my next choice for next phone, huawei, if they keep doing good thing with up to date android releases, killer camera, and reasonable price with this good product quality.---- additional after a couple week usage ---the phone is not a 5 stars phone. i own motox pure edition and samsung7. the phone was slowing down after a couple day use without rebooting, while my other phones could go days and week without reboot and no decrease performance. yes this could be because of 32gb ram capacity. therefore i put down to 4 stars review. i\\'ll defly bring this phone for traveling however as the second phone. the primary use for this phone just because of the camera. buenos dias el dia 22 de agosto le compre una blackberry 9780 necesito la copia de la factura original para que pueda llegar a venezuela el equipo llego sin factura phone has querty keyboard which my wife wanted. same phone as i have.phone is good but has a tendency to go to \"locked\" too often making it onerous to use. display is broken i bought this with the intention of using it on wifi for a while to decide if it would make a good phone. i still have not connected it with a cellular service, so i can\\'t comment on call quality, but i do intend to. i was a little concerned about the screen size, the battery size and the amount of memory.the memory is workable if you remember to shut down apps that you aren\\'t using. it\\'s less tolerant of lots of apps running in the background than, some higher end devices like my nexus 7, but with a little attention, it\\'s not a problem.the battery, while small by today\\'s standards, is adequate, given the small screen and modest processor power.the screen is decent. it doesn\\'t like steep viewing angles, but despite its low resolution, still looks sharp, thanks to its small size. speaking of size, the screen is legible and usable despite its size. it just displays less information at a time. it slows me down a bit, but it\\'s a trade off for the small size of the phone.cameras: not to be used for anything important, but they work for still shots and video.bottom line- this is a cheap phone, so adjust expectations accordingly. that said, it is a capable phone which does the things you would expect a smartphone to do, with the added benefit of being very cheap, light and tiny. works great! bought it used and had no problems whatsoever. very happy! im an apple and android user traditionally. picked this sweet little puppy up as a back up. keyboard clicks great, internet is reasonably fast, condition of the device was great. great little buy out of contract for $180. this is a great replacement phone. has all the bells and whistles as a more expensive phone. the speakeer phone is great. the voice call id is very up to date and the camera very good. good dont hesitate to buy this phone, it is like brand new. mine doesn\\'t have a single scratch and it works perfect on my tmobile carrier. great phone replacement for our other phone. shipped fast and for a used phone, it works perfectly and there weren\\'t as many defects on the phone as described. it was better. so far so good. i would recommend nice phone for the money. ... it\\'s nice and fun excellent phone, works perfectly with at&t, love it. reached on time. yet to open the package... it\\'s a gift for a friend brilliant phone.somewhat clumsy software optimizations create actual usable battery life. last 3 phones would get 1.5-3 hours sot at most (note 3, g4, s6). this phone gets 4-6 hours sot.nice screen.great updates so far. on the 9/1/16 security patch as of mid-october, with 2 ota updates in past 3 weeks.usb-c is much nicer ergonomically than microusb.works out of the box with cricket and straight talk.only downside right now is limited case availability. none from major case vendors right now. using the oem clear case, which is too minimalist for my tendency to drop the phone every now and then. works perfectly. arrived on time. all you really need. excellent phone i had a samsung galaxy s3 prior to this and it broke. did not want to sign on for another contract or spend $500 on a new one so i bought this for $150. pros: internet speed and connection are good. nice size. good screen resolution. cheap!cons: photo quality is pretty poor. keypad is a major pain: 50% of the time, chooses the wrong letter and provides really ridiculous word suggestions. takes me double the time to write a text than it did with my old phone and i wasn\\'t thrilled with the text messaging on that one either. forget about writing an email because you might lose your mind in frustration trying to type it. it will do for now. lumia 920 operates still as a top notch, even after 2 years of it\\'s launch. my friends liked my current lumia 920 and ordered 2 new units for my friends. this phones doesn\\'t work well.. this phone is amazing and i bought this phone without no problem and i am very happy for amazon.com and lg g3 . i am sugguesting everybody get this phone quickly you have feel better and better thank you amazon thank you lg :) everything excelent! i love it phone was in great shape just as promised in original box daughter was very happy. this phone is awesome, except for that when i received it, the microphone didn\\'t work during phone calls, unless on speaker. and even then, it was cutting in and out. the phone itself is great. but this little problem is widespread. make sure once you buy this phone, it is in full working condition. other than that, its an awesome phone. great product love love it! protects the phone so well and is a gorgeous color. love it, good price to! i liked the phone and delivery on time i bought this phone in april of 2015. besides a little phantom scrolling issue (where the screen would move while not being touched) the phone was okay. not spectacular, but definitely sufficient for calling/texting/photo purposes. i\\'ve never had to add a memory card to it so the space is also sufficient as there is virtually no bloatware.the real problem came around month 5 of owning this phone. the charger that came with this phone would no longer charge it. i bought another from amazon and it charged the phone for almost 2 weeks before it stopped working. because i assumed it was just a malfunction with blu chargers, i then bought a series of other chargers, one lg charger from my local cell phone store, one onn charger from walmart and a portable charging bank by motorola (which is really great!) from groupon. suffice it to say, none of these charged my phone very long. they do, however, work for my 2 tablets and my son\\'s phone.so i contacted blu customer service, they asked me a series of questions and then sent me an email to a link asking the same series of questions with a request to upload a file containing my amazon order receipt. i was told to call them back after i had uploaded the file. i did as instructed and was greeted by a very rude customer service agent who just shuffled me off to a \"warranty claim processor\" who needed me to then ask me the same series of questions again! so after this 4th round of q&a i was tired of talking to them and just asked when i\\'d receive a replacement phone. the rep told me i would have to pay to ship the phone back to them and would not receive a replacement for a month! what am i supposed to do without a phone for a month?! please save yourself a headache and never purchase from blu. they are inconsiderate, not at all customer-focused and obviously make sub-par products that they do not stand behind. looks and works very good. has a small scratch on the screen, but i guess that is why priced $50 lower than others. --does not bother me as long as i saved $. love this phone! excellent !! this is a pretty good phone for texting. it has a nice keyboard, and a 1.3 mp camera. the first one that came had a bad microsd slot. cellular gallery inc. was really good about sending a replacement. they even pretested the microsd slot before sending it. this replacement unit works great!a small snag - at&t needed to enter the serial number into their system before the sim card would work. that necessitated a trip to the at&t store. good prodduct all we have acquired smartphone blu brand, we know that we are excellent devices, particularly recommend. i\\'m really happy with my purchase. the phone is working great. i\\'ve had it for about a month now and no problems with it. i\\'m really happy. stellar phone for the price. to break it down:+ screen looks great+ great battery life, usually still have 50% left by the end of the day+ takes a 64gb sd card (sandisk - haven\\'t tried other brands)+ good wifi and cell reception+ no noticible delays when running apps+ the mono-speaker gets pretty loud (though it\\'s obviously still a phone speaker, so don\\'t expect miracles)+ feels solid (doesn\\'t feel cheap)- camera doesn\\'t have autofocus. i didn\\'t think i would mind this, but it turns out that the chase quickdeposit app requires an autofocus camera- the headphone output is quieter than expected. it\\'s fine for actual headphone use, but when i hook it up to my car i usually have to crank my car volume about 2-3x as loud as normal.+/- it runs kitkat. that opens up a lot of the newest features, but it also means that you have limited use of your sd card. you can google \"kitkat sd card\" for more info, but it was something i didn\\'t realize when i bought it.of course it would be great if the phone had lte, 4k screen, etc....but for the money it will be tough to beat. gizmo trader took great care of me and the phone was described to a t down to a scratch on the corner......very good company and even better products i bought this phone to replace my blu vivo which i loved but broke. i thought this phone would be an upgrade, but it\\'s terrible. the battery does not last any longer than any other phone and the phone freezes almost constantly. the screen brightness is also very dull. i\\'ve been trying to return it but the only response i receive from blu is to do a factory reset. i know it was a used product but the seller never told me that the volume button was removed from device ....anyway after i tested the phone it worked very fine and the problem with the volume button... solved with an android app that sets all sounds from touch screen. i love the item that i got it work very well i really enjoy this casio phone. if youre not into smart phones, this one is a gem. its a good phone. battery doesn\\'t last beware!!! i just bought this phone june 13th worked great no problems july 15th no longer works in the box is a piece of paper that states 90 day limited warranty but when i tried to return it states 30-day......beware!!! excellent excelente i was verrrry leary ordering this phone thinking that it probably would not work and so on. thank god amazon has a great return policy! turns out, the phone looked brand new!!! arrived fast and phone works flawlessly. the phone i ordered was unlocked and i was able to put in international sim card and works great! phone was exactly what i ordered. it was a much needed upgrade from a flip phone. i had a lot of fun with this phone. my 3rd smart phone, 2nd android phone. unusable out of the box, transformed into a very nice phone thanks to devs, cm10 and other jelly bean based roms. no longer have it but had fun rooting and loading different roms back in 2010-11. will always remember this little guy. loved high res lcd 800x480 on 3.7\" is still very nice today. my new 4.5\" has lower ppi than this. everything looks vibrant and nice. 3mp camera is better than other 3mp in its class for stills and video. i was excited to use the front cam with skype. was my first smart phone with the front cam. vga but still useful. removable back cover, replaceable battery, if that matters. takes standard size sim. runs different gps apps, almost never had gps issues.my only complaint the ringer is very quiet, compared to other phones i\\'ve head by nokia and lg. the volume rocker is very soft. i often accidentally pressed it with my fingers. out of the box needs to be rooted, debloated, custom-rommed, app2sd a must due to low internal memory. otherwise its just a laggy pos. it\\'s ok awesome phone got it on time and works great! i was a little skeptical but so happy once i got my phone delivered. you get what you pay for right? this got me through way too long of a period after i broke my phone. couldn\\'t really stand it though, although it had its perks. taught me to spend less time on my phone and enjoy life a bit more. screen has an effect that kind of gave me a headache to look at it. sort of a blur effect. super slow. texting is faster on an old t9 flip phone. i put this is 3 stars because it\\'s ok based on the price. not horrible, and probably compares well to your other options. was nice to upgrade to the galaxy s7 from this baby. excelent bueno great i cant believe this phone didnt come with a charger. no return label in the shipping box. soo disapointing. excellent phone! i like how they customize the icons as they are colorful. no need for a separate sd card, the memory is built in. it comes with free screen protector and back casing. it\\'s very light weight and wide screen. the camera takes great photos. highly recommended. yes as described & in great condition if you are looking at this phone in this day and age, you probably know what you want anyway, and you will not be disappointed. great phone, so far no issues and the fingerprint scanner is great, never thought i would need one, but now that i have one, i don\\'t think ill ever go back. great budget android for anyone looking. the lumia 640 xl is an excellent phone. it takes amazing, very sharp photos that match the quality of phones that are three times it\\'s cost. it runs very smoothly despite it\\'s low-mid tier processor, which translates to having better battery life without compromising user experience. i\\'ve been using this phone for weeks now, and it has not once gone below the 50% mark - even after having it on for nearly 2 days!additional pros over ios and android:- glance screen: the lumia 640 xl gives users the option to always show the time and notifications while eating up very little power.- double tap to wake / sleep: you can double tap the screen, or the navigation bar to wake and put your phone to sleep respectively.- tiles: this is actually a huge one for me. people often dislike the tile interface, but i personally love it. it\\'s so easy to find out what tasks i need to attend to on my phone with just one look at the screen. if i need to respond to someone\\'s text, i won\\'t forget because a number is going to show up on the text icon, even if i\\'ve cleared notifications.- synchronization: this is my second lumia, and the ability to automatically bring over all my apps, and settings from my older phone made the upgrade process so painless.- smoothness: if someone handed you the phone, you would have no idea that this is a sub $250 phone because of how smooth it is. it\\'s build also screams quality.advantages over iphone:- the case is removable! this means that if you scratch the case, or scuff it, or crack it, it\\'s always replaceable for a mere $15. i really like this compared to my old iphone.- additional storage via sd card: you can add an sd card to your phone, increasing it\\'s on board storage by up to 128 gb for less than $50. (i got the 64 gb micro sd available on this site for $23)disadvantages over android:- no widgets: widgets were really nice on my old galaxy s3. i wish the tiled interface would be a bit more interactive.- facebook messenger: the facebook messenger app on android had a \"widget\" that would always be there despite the app. this made it easier to multi-task while on facebook messenger.all in all, i have to say that this is the best phone i\\'ve owned to date. i\\'ve used the galaxy s3, iphone 4s, lumie 635, and now this. the fact that this phone is sub $250 unlocked and off contract and can effectively compete with flagship phones three times it\\'s price makes this purchase an incredible value. i was skeptical about getting this phone over the e71. all the reviews attacked this phone as not worth it. well i sadly don\\'t have a e71 my jump was from the n79 to this business phone. my decision was based on the 100 dollar difference against the same os i was using, symbian s60 3rd fp2 and the 5 mp camera. i could successfully upgrade most of my n79 apps into e72.software:the huge upgrade aside of the business orientation model is the stability.i have found myself listening music, playing snes on a symbian emulator, with facebook and twitter apps on, my opera browser, chats (whatsapp), etc, abruptly interrupted by the \"email notification\". all i have to do is go to my home screen with \"end conversation button\" (or email button that i haven\\'t get used to yet) look for the new email, reply it and go back to my game or any other program i require.i like installing all type of stuff i found on the web. pretty much everything runs. i have more problems with the screen orientation 320x240 than the actual phone managing the application. i have opened heavy pdf that my n79 would either crash or take fore ever to open.the ovi maps on this device is way faster, way more clear and with more options such as own voice, and street names. this one is amazing because streets names change in this city every corner. you don\\'t take too much attention to the phone \"visual\" directions since it tells you the next turn is at \"coyoacan ave\" etc.hardware:the hardware is fine, not the best i have seen, my n79 was made in mexico and felt solid. this one is made in china, still it\\'s just different design. the power on button is \"loose\" it feels like it will fall off, although haven\\'t. the little connector (miniusb) is covered by a thin plastic thing that i have never like it. i treat my phones really well but i don\\'t know if it can handle a not so careful user. people complain about the sensor navi key, i totally agree. i dislike it. its ok for browsing in the web, but for moving around in the menu, well i just turn it off, problem solved.i don\\'t regret getting this phone, it fits me for all my needs so fat. i have had this for a month now, it still has a lot to go. actually i like the phone. the instruction book you need a magnifying glass to read. even with glasses the print is just very small. i went online and printed the book from there. there are no outlets that carry a case for the phone. so i ordered from an amazon seller and found what they said was a blu cover for a dash jr. it looked like it, but it was not what it looked like. back to the phone, i am still learning it, and am enjoying it. carol i am impressed with the quality of this phone,the xperia z5 display excellent color reproduction and sharpness, has an excellent image, the glass screen feels sturdy, the software and hardware environment respond quickly and smooth, i have been using continuously and has no overheating by the continued use of streaming as z3,the xperia z5 is very well put together, with gorilla glass 4 on the front and back, an aluminum frame and rubber bumpers on the corners to help absorb shock if the phone is dropped,the camera has truly excellent auto-focus,regarding the battery of sony phone i do not see a big difference compared to other phones like samsung or iphone s6,but the biggest departure in design terms, is the look of the power button. sony’s trademark protruding chrome-effect circle, which has been around for years, has now been replaced by an elongated lozenge, slightly inset from the edge to prevent you accidentally pressing it.i particularly recommend this phone to a friend. this phone was great up until the 2 week mark or owning it. now it freezes all the time and the screen goes black and wont turn on again until you take out the battery and reboot the entire thing. not to mention that it has horrible ram, practically no internal storage, and you cant run 2 apps at once. i cant listen to music and look on instagram, wth is that about. i do not recommend buyng this phone for anyone unless you truly hate this person and want them to go insane. i have only had sony cell phones for over 10 years. nice phone and very happy with this purchase. loved this phone until the day it felt and the screen got damaged. unable to find a replacement ever since. i\\'ve been using it for about a week now. it\\'s a great phone for the price. the large size is taking some getting accustomed to, but it does make everything incredibly easy to see. exactly as promised bueno first time i received the phone from the seller everything seemed fine, but after 2 days the loud speakers stopped working. then i sent the phone back to the seller and he told me that he had another phone and that he was getting it tested by apple to make sure everything worked properly. come to find out after waiting 2 weeks for a my phone..that all he did was repair the same one i had sent in. do not ever buy an item from rolyg! you will be disappointed! i was very pleased with the phone. my daughter loves the phone and it sends and receives text messages very quickly even though we\\'re using a t-mobile sim card in a verizon phone. i had a question about the phone and the seller got back to me by e-mail withing a few hours and politely answered my question. i will definitely buy again from this seller in the future. product is as per description... it is just awesome. it came quite on time and as described. i will recommend this sale to anybody i know i just received this \"unlocked\" iphone 5s two days ago and was happy until i but i tried to put my sim card in. no service so i called my carrier t-mobile and oh guess what the phone has a carrier lock on it with guess who t-mobile. needless to say i\\'m pissed and without a phone or money and have yet to get a reply or a refund. zero stars!!! awesome phone! great product! very satisfied. very bad experience with buying this phone!i disguta the product was offered as new, and not buy it as such and i was eviado used equipment that only lasted four weeks in use, since the instrument housing plate looked new but had no production values\\u200b\\u200b, is had that call records, text messages in the mailbox and out and cajaa was with the seals opened, it tells me that the computer was in use beyond ..now the computer is not available until today i could not fix anything, he as lost phone ..absolutely not recommend anyone to buy this product time ....very disappointed by the deception of what i get ...thank you very muchthe phone i bought as new and used sent me fits my s5 with no problem. excelente absolutely love this phone. would buy again really good worked well for a while then all of a sudden people can\\'t hear me when i call or when they call me. yet the mic works for recording. not happy with my purchase great replacement phone for my daughter. put in old sim card and it fired right up upon arrival keys i, k, b and number 7 did not work. none of the function keys worked and the camera button was broke. the only upside to this purchase was amazon\\'s return policy. this phone is horrible the speaker and volume is very low. do not know what to make of this the samsung galaxy s3 is a very good product, l like it and have had no problem with it so far. i was very happy with the phone i got for the price. everything works great. my only complaint is i didn\\'t receive any headphones. wasn\\'t able to handle mid-demanding apps and life-spawn of this is less than 9 months. not a quality phone. i have been a loyal sony xperia z1s and z3 user and wanted to upgrade to the z5. xperia z5 crashed repeatedly during startup process and then continued to do so with minimal use, even trying to open main menu screens. factory reset did not fix anything. returned it within a day and i\\'ll have to wait for the next model to see if they ironed out the kinks. excelente recomendado 100% been very happy with this phone so far. it\\'s affordable, and adequately meets basic needs. i\\'m using it on my at&t service with no trouble at all. it won\\'t handle graphically intensive games or apps very well, but it\\'s not really intended to. the available memory is very low, but you can find a card for cheap to increase the storage. i selected an 8gig add on option when i purchased the phone and it has been enough for my needs.it has great sound with audio or video, the touch screen is responsive, and not overly sensitive, and it has a good picture. overall a great phone for a good price. i\\'d definitely purchase this brand again. this is the wrose phone i ever had, the phone stops working all the time, it locks up and i have to remove the battery to rebot it. it\\' s also out dated, most of the apps i use would not even down load and some wouldn\\'t run. the recessed on botton may have seem like a good idea, but it\\'s hard to use when you have to look for it. i\\'m going to try to return it if i can i have had for a while now. works great! i wrote my review of the blu studio 6.0 for the case. the blu studio 6.0 has some design flaws. one has trouble picking it up without changing the volume &/or turning the screen off. the controls should have been placed elsewhere or perhaps sunken in. also, the battery runs down quickly, often less than a day; a problem i\\'ve never had before. having problems with phone after a month. i believe this was a refurbished phone and not a new phone. i\\'ll save money to buy a brand new samsung galaxy cell phone. it\\'s worth it. such a great phone. no issues at all. i love it my cricket sim card works great transaction, outstanding phone, a bit pricey but the best possible at this time. i love the htc smart phone. easy to use and has everything i need on a phone i like that battery don\\'t work very pleased with purchase. works as described. a very novel item that will get many comments. not for people with large fingers. screen ivery clear and bright. only a 4 gig memory but it has a slot to upgrade with a sd card. since price is low good first phone for children. excellent! love it does not support 4g / lte. great phone! in fact best phone i ever had for now. with the otterbox defender case that i bought, it will stay just like new for years. great battery, light, alot of features. also as i leave in haiti, this model particulary works on both digicel and natcom (4g on digicel and 3g on natcom) when i first got this phone, i didn\\'t know how to use it but eventually, i got to find out about the features the phone has. one of the features the phone has is that it has a flashlight app which i can use to search for things in darkness, a f.m radio app, and a phone manager app which allows you to scan your phone for any viruses, closes any open apps, etc. apart from those apps i mentioned earlier, there are other features the phone has as well, but you would have to buy it in order to discover them. the only drawback is that the phone freezes sometimes, but other than that, it is ok for any person to use as long as there is a sim card in the phone which will activate the phone service. just ok phone😩 love this phone! the only frustration i had was very small, i dislike that when you type a colan and a close parenthesis it automatically costs to an emoji. so, :) and :p as well as others would be corrected to emojis. other than this small problem, i love everything else about the phone! great sound, good memory, works well! bought this for my grandmother to replace her budget samsung smartphone. much bigger and better screen, she can now easily read anything on the phone. the speakerphone feature also works very well. camera isn\\'t top notice but i would say it is slightly above average.so far no complaints from her! well worth the price for a carrier/contract free phone! worked for a while like a year or so.....then suddenly stopped. takes pictures horrible. low storage as well. great phone for the price very satisfied with the purchase, the product was received in the due date, product quality and very good transaction with the seller, works to perfection with the operators of the country very happy with the product quality 100% seems to be quite good. had an iphone 5c and this phone for the price i paid was a great upgrade in my opinion. i bought the phone so i can use overseas and it worked. also its easy for my mom to use, and the price is good. the samsung galaxy s5 is a fantastic phone, but the one i received from this seller was defective. i didn\\'t find out until after it was activated, so this presents a big problem for me. the problem is that the it won\\'t charge the battery. the first time it charged the battery to 40% and that is when i had to take it to the at&t store to get it activated. when i returned home, i put it back on charge and let it charge for a couple of hours before i returned to get it. the phone was not charging, and it was 1% changed. i reset the phone and it charged again, when it got to 30%, i installed the update. i thought the update might fix the charging problem. after the update, the phone was reset while it finished installing, that all went fine. i saw that the phone was charging so i left it on the charger and went o sleep. when i returned, 7 hours later, it had stopped charging, and the phone was charged to 19%. so all the problems with the phone have to do with the charging. i also tried the finger print scanner as a method to unlock the phone, but after it was trained, it took way to many tries to get it to read my finger correctly. it was a good thing that the phone had a backup password that could bypass the finger print. i don\\'t know if i should order another one of these phones, i am pretty sure they are refurbished phones, but they avoid saying that in the description. muy bonito, ligero, y fácil de usar. pero no incluye la tarjeta microsd y creo de deberían de poner un manual de instrucciones y recomendaciones. it came without accessories good the phone came on time! and is a perfect phone! excellent phone phone was flawlesslooked brand new the phone was brand new and worked perfectly. because of failing vision, i bought the note 4 (my third galaxy) primarily for its screen size and font size, and was surprised by the wealth of other features. for example, s-voice, which is like iphone\\'s siri,does so many tasks, like addressing a text message, providing for dictating the text, tapping on the text to bring up a keyboard screen, where you can manually correct, then dictate some more. this is just the tip of the iceberg about the note 4. it suits me just fine and then some. highly recommended. .battery not good full charged after 2 hr battery charge down to 10 % . i send the package back to amazon via ups at yesterday ( 2016 april 17) the phone keep freezing , perfect good it is good phone el teléfono llego con todo, audífonos, cd, mini-manual, cable de datos, cargador.en excelentes condiciones, (sin la funda) caja abierta pero sin problemas.luego de un día el software se daño sin razón alguna, no se si tiene que ver con el proveedor o realicé alguna acción incorrecta. de resto hasta ahorita, excelente señal, 3g para movistar, movilnet en mi país (venezuela) y manejabilidad buena. lo compre a fgs trading. the screem was easy to crack and the touch screem stop working but was ok love it. great for fitness tracker, cell phone calls are clear and easy to make and receive, lots of functions. as advertised, easy to figure out. lots of youtube video. recommended seller. i bought this phone because my moto g 3rd generation started messing up once it updated to marshmallow 6.0. there was no way i could downgrade to lollipop, so i began searching for a new phone. ive had blu phones before and i love them. i just hate the low variety of phone cases. but anyways, this phone is amazing! my only issue i can say is i can\\'t se all the new emojis due to it only being lollipop. but that\\'s very minute. the camera is great, storage is great, and it runs smooth and fast. what shocked me the most is the camera. the back camera produces very quality professional photos. the front facing camera isn\\'t bad either. get in some good light and those pics look great as well! the design of the phone is so stylish. i just love it. great phone, verry satisfied has to be the worst product i have purchased from amazon! the ease of texting is amazing!!! although, the phone doesn\\'t hold a charge for as long as it should and the numbers of dropped calls are ridiculous! i don\\'t use the phone much for calls and yet it needs to be charged daily..... had i known, i wouldn\\'t have purchased. i have never had this bad of an experience with any so-called new phone before. wouldn\\'t recommend it to anyone! very disappointed... i use amazon frequently and this purchase has totally turned me off! can do everything and more that i expected. htc are only phones i\\'ve decided to use . and i haven\\'t been disappointed with any that i\\'ve had. i loved this phone. i recently upgraded to a htc my touch 4g but i miss my exhibit. this phone is so dependable. i have thrown this phone several times and it has been dropped more times than i can count. it has also been dropped in water ( i mean literaly submerged) in the tub and nothing on that phone quit working. this was my first droid phone and i would recommend it to anyone. my co worker had a lg and when it was dropped in water her camera quit working, but on the exhibit, no issues. the only complaint is that t-mobile needs a little better coverage but other than that, i loved the phone it\\'s self. it was so easy to use that my 5 year old daughter had her on app page and could change the settings herself to adjust to her games. excellent phone i bought this phone for my nephew and he is really happy with it, is a cheap phone and works really well the canada is 5 mp but it\\'s ok. nice exellet been using this phone for a couple of weeks and so far it works great. i wish it had more usable storage than 2 gigabyte, large apps use it up quick but, with a 32 gig memory card you have more than enough space for your pictures and files. i had a little bit of trouble finding a carry case for it but with a little work i located one here on amazon. i get great reception with this phone and all of the features work well. i plan on purchasing a second one for my wife soon. this phone is the ultimate. it does everything and does it well, easy to learn and manage, great size to replace my tablet in a pinch, very good i have been looking forward to this phone since i knew my contract was going to be up soon.i got what i ordered! :) i had this phone for a few weeks now and its worth every penny. just love it this phone is expendsive n outraglly retarted, it is slow, u dont get phone calls if ur on the internet, or even checking fb... great phone, but i did my research and bought the 900f for the 4g lte capabilities and i have metropcs services and it turns out that it will only run on 3g h+..it cannot work on 4g, i am disappointed because i really wanted this phone..i love it, but it will not work on 4g. amazing, battery longs for ever.. i have serious concerns about the non standard android interface. well... is better than naked android folks... and i loved the aspect , the screen, the digital fingerprint id access... at first it seemed like a great purchase. but i soon realized this phone has a lot of kinks. apps, webpages, or even the pictures folder are slow to open, and sometimes require a phone restart before they work again. this can cause a lot of problems when trying to use the uber app or quickly snap a pic of a moment. there are some weird bugs like the keyboard appearing or disappearing when it shouldn\\'t. i don\\'t recommend this phone, but i already paid for it, so i guess i\\'ll try to get some mileage out of it before getting a new one. the one great thing about this phone is the battery life (only about 30-40% loss per day). my service carrier is t-mobile. work fine to me, and that\\'s saying a lot. trust me it would not download pictures from text messages and would not work with my vans uconnect wireless phone system. am returning it. i use this phone mostly at work. it\\'s very small and dose not take up a lot of space. i have a lot of equipment on my person as a security guard in a hospital.i can honest day that i some time forget i have it in my front shir pocket. so far so good. great phone! i like the fact that apple has allowed a little more freedom to customize. phone would be awesome but unless you are a dealer or know how to unlock phones, you cant put it on any plans. this a great little phone for texting. too easy to get hot it\\'s. a great watch does what they say it will. but i worry about the clasp...i know it works now but when the holes in the band get worn , is there another type of band to replace this one?i wear my watch everyday i love this watch!! i just don\\'t want to lose it. excelentes practical and specific for calls. increíble! gracias! i arrived in good condition responds well but i battery lasts less than 3 hours and button illumination menu seems that no light this case has held up really well. it is easy to get my phone in and out of yet it still protects it well. i\\'ve dropped my 6+ a few times and have not had any issue with damaging my phone with this case. i do use glass screen protectors, but the case has worked fantastically with and without them. great case; a little heavy, but does the job right! beautiful, functional and reliable smartphone. has a decent battery life and impressive camera. great phone does everything i need it and then some good phone for the price. iphone se love the phone, but it overheats quite a bit which can shut down apps. it doesn\\'t take long for it to cool down. best camera on a phone i\\'ve ever owned without a doubt. güzel ürün ama. satıcı olumsuz ardarda iki telofon siparişi verdim biri geldi diğeri gelmedi this phone definitely exceeds my expectations excellent product quality 1 of the best phone better then i expected!!! :-) i received the phone with the \"on\" button missing. i took it into the apple store and they said it was counterfeit and refused to fix it. i contacted the seller but they refused to do anything. good product good i really love my phone everything works great. this phone is absolutely great. easy setup, plenty fast, and it works with all major carriers; what else could you want? the phone itself is built well too; gorilla glass 3, metal trim, and extremely rugged and sturdy even without a phone case (but i would suggest one anyway). in terms of specs it\\'s actually pretty comparable to most current generation flagship phones as well (maybe 10-20% less specs). the battery lasts long and has the turbo charge feature, and the screen quality and sound quality are both stellar! but most of all the #1 thing about this phone that will really push it over the edge is the price which is unbelievable!now amazon has a version of this phone that makes it more affordable in exchange for ads but for me i just couldn\\'t see how saving $50 was worth seeing ads for the entire life of the phone. this phone (plus model) also has better specs than the amazon one, has a quite a bit better camera, and has my favorite feature ever: a fingerprint scanner that not only secures your phone but wakes it too. i mean really this phone has just about everything you could want and then some, and apparently is water resistant (i haven\\'t tested and don\\'t intend to try). ultimately if you\\'re looking for value on a phone and really can\\'t see yourself dumping $600-900 on a flagship phone then this is definitely the phone for you.the one thing i will say about this phone is it does seem to have the overheating problems everyone talks about. it\\'s not like dangerously hot or anything but it\\'s definitely warmer than most other phones; however, it only gets hot when it\\'s under severe load like recording video (for long periods), playing a hardware intensive game, or loading up all your apps from your old device. despite these problems though it\\'s still well worth the money as you\\'re not going to find a phone with this much value without camping outside a store for 48 hours for black friday. no mobile hotspot i love the phone all-be-it it feels light cheaply made. i have service thru boost & it would have been nice if they would have offered to \"unlock\" it so as to be able to use this phone with whatever cellphone service one has. other than that it works great!!! phone came as it should have, everything was included: earbuds, charger, manual, all in original packaging. this is four stars because i know this phone was supposed to come with a samsung fast charger, which i did get. but it is a ginormous two piece charger that is unnecessary. it\\'s twice as large as the one that was supposed to be included.now the phone is a beast. after about a month my only complaints are that the phone does get unnecessarily warm even when not gaming and the battery life can last you about a day, which is fine considering the phone can charge from 25% to full in about an hour. good cellphone, have been using it in venezuela with no issues. would buy again. the first lg env3 i rec\\'d had problems with the speaker. within 3 days i had a new one that works great. the customer service was great! they were very prompt and made it hassle free for me, they sent a prepaid package for my return that i just had to drop in my mailbox. it is nice to actually have a hassle free return and a company that responses quickly. i will certainly use them again. within the first day one single black light went out which was fine in my opinion i just message the company. but they never got back to me which is poor customer service in my opinion but whatever.the actual operating system ran like a champ but the backlight it\\'s just getting worse and worse. thankfully i just ended up getting a different phone anyway. good for the money though. though it\\'s only been 24 hours, i am super impressed by the alcatel onetouch idol 3 4.7 inch smartphone (name is terrible though). this is a great time for affordable, mid-range, unlocked, no-contract smartphones. this phone slots in between the two models of the 3rd generation moto g. other than the ram (1.5 gb vs 2 gb), it\\'s very similar in specs to the more expensive moto g model but at the price of the less expensive moto g model (for now). i bought the alcatel instead of the moto g because it has a smaller, sleeker design (4.7 inch vs 5.0 inch screen and half as thin) and terrific front-facing stereo speakers. the screen is sharp and the speakers are very loud! the idol 4.7 looks similar to the old google nexus 4, which i owned, but slimmer and sleeker (and more plasticy). it\\'s a little smaller than an iphone 6 despite having the same screen size, and about as thin. the moto g has much more durable build and is waterproof, and i suspect, better support. both the alcatel and the moto g make great backup or travel phones, and also starter smartphones for teens. they can also be very solid everyday phones for most consumers. as the wireless companies move away from contracts and subsidizing phones, i wonder whether more folks will start moving to some of the mid-range phones. many folks have been paying $600-800 every two years for new phones without really knowing it. perhaps apple will be safe with its high-end clientele--at least for now--but companies like samsung are very vulnerable. these $200 phones are more than good enough for the typical user--with performance comparable to the flagship phones from two years ago. i worry a bit about durability given the materials it\\'s made out of. i should probably buy a case, but the phone is so sleek and attractive that i kind of don\\'t want to put one on. five stars for the amazing value! the quality to price ratio for this phone is terrific. don\\'t let the somewhat pedestrian tech specs fool you - the blu vivo 5 (also known as the gionee elife s6 in some countries) is an outstanding phone. this review will be a quick overview more than a detailed analysis of what makes this phone great, but i hope i can help some of you who might not be sure whether they should take the plunge.the pros: the vivo 5 has 3gb of ram, the standard for flagship phones of last year, and rather relaxed memory management. this makes for a phone that often holds onto apps long after you need them, and it\\'s much better about this than, for example, the samsung galaxy s6. this is almost unprecedented for a phone at this price point and is a standout feature of this phone. if you\\'re a heavy multitasker, this phone will give you no trouble.also impressive is the screen. at 720p and 5.5 inches, it\\'s actually pretty low resolution compared to other phones, even in the same price group (the asus zenfone 2, huawei honor 5x, and alcatel idol 3, for example). but it\\'s a panel that, in every other respect, is comparable to the amoled screens of the samsung galaxy s6 or huawei nexus 6p. its colors are pretty and saturated, video looks great, and games are gorgeous. i can\\'t get over the fact that this is a $200 phone with such a pretty display - it\\'s about on par with the 1080p panel on the alcatel idol 3, which has one of the best ips lcds i\\'ve ever seen on a phone. but i digress.the phone is appreciably speedy, handling most animations through home screens and the ui in general with ease. most games will run fine at worst - but in general they run extremely well. don\\'t expect incredible benchmark scores - it scores 10000 less in antutu than the lg g3 (the t-mobile branded d851, if it matters) it replaced for me. but in day to day usage, it is a lot more smooth and fluid than my g3 was.the metal build feels great and unlike a lot of other metal phones doesn\\'t seem to get too hot under normal use or even benchmarking.the buttons are clicky and easy to tell apart. with the included case the metal feel is lost but the plastic seems high quality and it\\'s not slippery on the back, a problem some cases can have.battery life is outstanding. i can last roughly a day and a half between recharges with moderate use. i figure it has plenty to do with the mix of a power-sipping upper midrange mediatek soc and 720p display.rear camera performance is pretty good (not mind-blowing) in most lighting conditions, though lower light isn\\'t quite as good. the front camera is a bit noisy indoors but is plenty acceptable in most other conditions.wi-fi speeds are phenomenal and better than what you can generally expect with a comparable qualcomm chip. lte speeds aren\\'t as good, but they\\'re fine for what you\\'d generally use for lte and due to the screen any video apps will top out at 720p anyways.the cons: there are some bad points about the vivo 5, though, and i\\'d be remiss if i didn\\'t mention them. the vivo 5\\'s cheaper cousin, the vivo xl, has a much wider range of lte bands, as does the life one x. depending on where you live, this may be important, since some at&t and t-mobile bands alike aren\\'t represented on the vivo 5.the vivo 5 lacks on screen buttons, meaning in applications that support immersive mode, you might accidentally hit the capacitive buttons. i would\\'ve loved to see a software toggle to turn off the back and overview buttons while in a game, like recent samsung phones offer.the vivo 5 also launches with a android 5.1 lollipop, which is a version old by now. not only that, it\\'s a version with extremely heavy customizations. while some are nice, such as the android 6.0-style permissions management, others, like the notification management and lack of app drawer on the stock launcher, are sometimes frustrating. along with some features of stock lollipop missing, such as smart lock, it makes for a poor user experience in many ways.the display panel is only 720p at 5.5\", and if you\\'re paying attention it can be noticeable. there\\'s thankfully not much in the way of screen door effect like some lower-ppi displays, but individual pixels are far from invisible.the nearly flat back on such a huge phone makes it a bit difficult to hold, though the metal is not too slippery and the included case even less so.the audio quality from the internal speakers and included earbuds is fine, as is audio output from bluetooth. however, when tested with my sony mdr-7506 headphones, there was audible crackling noise. actually, \"audible\" is probably not the right word. the noise is downright loud and can be heard easily even while you\\'re listening to something. this is certainly not an audiophile\\'s phone and it\\'s clear that audio was one of the corners cut with the vivo 5.the included case nullifies a lot of the ergonomics of the buttons. they\\'re still clicky, but harder to tell apart. it also prevents most headphones from plugging into the jack all the way, reducing sound quality even more than the vivo 5 already does. even the included earbuds don\\'t seem to go in all the way with the case on, but audio quality is good enough with them.the capacitive buttons on the front of the phone lack a backlight. on my silver and white model, at least, this means the buttons are virtually invisible in certain lighting conditions.there is no fingerprint reader, while the identically priced honor 5x does have one.overall, despite the vivo 5\\'s shortcomings, i can\\'t recommend it more unless you need good audio quality through the headphone jack or live in an area outside of the vivo 5\\'s lte bands. it\\'s a fantastic phone, especially for the price.addendum and additional recommendations: blu does sell a few other phones with the same chipset if you\\'re not totally sold on the vivo 5. if you\\'re in an area with limited lte, i would advise getting the cheaper vivo xl, which, despite its lower storage, lower ram, and plastic build, is virtually identical in every other specification (including that gorgeous amoled screen) and actually supports more lte bands, including t-mobile\\'s band 12. it also has a user-replaceable battery, if that\\'s important to you. the blu life one x is another solid option for people who need a slightly smaller phone. it has a 1080p ips display, stock android, and virtually identical specifications to the vivo xl otherwise including the lte bands. i haven\\'t used either of these phones, though, so your mileage may vary.update (6 may 2016): the mt6753t chip in the vivo 5 has sha1 and sha2 support according to aida64, so i encrypted the phone\\'s internal storage. performance is virtually identical to before, but there are a few situations where the phone can end up getting hot - mostly stuff that makes practically any phone run hot. for example, charging and doing anything really taxing, like playback of 720p video, benchmarking, or heavy gaming will make the phone so warm as to be uncomfortable if the storage is encrypted and it wasn\\'t something i noticed before i did encrypt it. that said, if the phone isn\\'t charging, it still doesn\\'t get very warm.just so you know: with this 6 may update, i made a few tweaks for accuracy and grammar mistakes i had made in a previous version of this review, as well as trimming down a few unnecessary paragraphs. phone did not work properly refund issued without issue i bought this phone as a gift for my grandson.i had to go to work that friday 13th but he and his friends took it to the local at&t store and got it activated.he loves it! the ringer on my 4 year old bold 9930 quit for good a few weeks ago. as an 8 year bb user and business person, i was loathe to get an android phone - i need secure email and a physical keyboard since so much of my business is email based, as well as excellent phone quality. i had been hoping that the classic launch would receive favorable reviews. by the time my bold stopped functioning there were 112 reviews posted on amazon and they were for the most part outstanding. i decided to switch to another provided who supports the classic, and i purchased the phone. i have had the phone for a few weeks. it is the best phone i could possibly have ever dreamed of and i am still learning all of the functions.two of my high powered clients saw the phone on separate occasions and were extremely impressed - they did not even know of it\\'s existence. my 23 year old niece flipped when she saw the phone. i can surely say that blackberry needs some good pr and perhaps that along with this marvel hybrid will help to resurrect them, and deservedly so. excellent product!!! exelente such a bummer. the phone was marketed as un-locked. it an att box that said new- complete with apple-ear-buds etc.had already decided to free myself from t-mobile- went to cricket. store manager & his asst. tried to get this i-phone to work- multiple micro sim cards etc. result- store owner said something is wrong with the phone. so i figure on a total of six hours wasted. i guess- u get what u pay for. i really wanted an i-phone- but no way can i afford the new model. i received this item along with other items i ordered the same day. i\\'m looking forward to seeing if this phone will be better than my last phone. so far, so good. thank you, and keep up the great work! have been using this phone for two weeks now. i absolutely love it. sound quality is great, battery life is good. the pics look great! so happy i bought this phone. i did a lot of research before purchasing. great price for phone! would highly recommend! 😁 to all those wondering, this phone will work with straight talk, t-mobile, cricket, or any gsm network. it is not compatible with cdma networks like verizon and sprint. i\\'m using it with straight talk. i just put my sim card in and it was ready to go. this phone is a terrific buy! i have owned one for about a year now and i love it. i just replaced my son\\'s damaged samsung with the burst! he thinks it is a great phone. you can\\'t beat the price and all the features. excelent i purchased this phone for my boyfriend for christmas. a week later it offers a update and so he does and bam, phone no longer boot up. he has been without a phone since this bad update and still have not heard from customer service on how to fix it. looks like everyone who has this phone and tried the update is having the same problem. i have never written a bad review. thank you blu for being my first! the phone is all in russian and appears refurbished and not factory new. i managed to change the language but it had a number saved in its contacts which says a lot. besides that, a big problem is that the phone will only charge if plugged to the european charger with european prongs it came with or if plugged directly to the computer. this is not ok! no scratches, works 100 %, new , perfect cellphone. i purchased this cover through amazon. the price was really good. inner cover and outer cover. screen protector attached to the top section of the inner cover. no bubbles to worry about like the stick on plastic type. belt clip included. i have had it a few days now. the cover does its job. i recommend it. otterbox makes a car mount to attach the phone with this case. the last steve jobs design. i love this format. it\\'s still a phone. i don\\'t want a tablet on my ear. coming from a 5s, don\\'t see much diffrence. i was a bit scepticle about the phone being unlocked but i must say it is 400% unlocked. i don\\'t live in an area with at&t n those kind of big time companies i live in the caribbean with local phone companies and it works perfectly . i\\'m very very very happy with my purchase. bought from seller raydes he is amazing excellent everithing like it says on the descrption. perfect phone and accesories. works perfect in argentina!buy it now. real deal good job, good service, good product. product of very good quality. very good the product came to me very quickly, and in great condition. however i had to return it because i did not have the proper sim card size. if you have a smaller android phone, realize in order to use this product you need to upgrade your card, or also buy a simcard adapter (but this can be risky as some of them can mess up your phone). this watch met all my expectations got it for the wifey.decent performance, nice screen, comes with accessories like case, screen protector, headphones. she likes it as well. it is smooth and quick. large screen, easy to use. i got a sim card to ensure the phone would stay quick. very pleased with my purchase. excelente i love the phone. it serves my purpose generally. it has some very good features that i need in a phone. i do not want to give it up. however, i am unable to charge the battery. i still have my blackberry bold and luckily the batteries are the same so i can use it to charge my battery. what should i do? my favorite phone ever. batter life is decent, a couple days on average with lots of use. sounds is crisp and clear, good for both conversation and music. camera is better than some non-phone cameras. very convenient keyboard while maintaining small pocket size. i can\\'t wait for sony to update it.. love it when you make a review its important to consider what you are getting at the price you have paid. i can\\'t understand why people make fuss about the things that are not paid for. this phone is brilliant at this price. you simply cannot ask for more. and now with the lollipop update, you\\'ve already got way moreone suggestion - try lowering the top of the phone by a few cms in a way to ensure the top of the phone hits the center of your ear while talking. the sound was perfectly ok to hear in that position. the phones arrived on the first day of the promised time frame. sent the unlocked phones to india for family over there and they are very satisfied and the phones work great!!! love this design and it is perfect for protecting my iphone. good productarrive on time great deal! decent quality phone for the price. this phone lacks a few things that my s5 has, but it makes up for lack of hardware with great sony software. got one. wow! the kata v4 is easy to use and simple to setup. i have 2 providers, at&t and t mobile. i put both sim cards since v4 supports dual sim 3g comes up at&t and t mobile works perfect. the screen is 4.5” and memory is 8gb. i use it for traveling and on the go. i’m not afraid of losing it makes me much happier. the hotspot app is very unique. it’s the easiest way to share data. i’m surprised why lg, samsung and even iphone don’t have something like kata’s hotspot app. the hand feel and grip are very nice. for this price, i really really love this phone and its design. fantastic! excelente delivered on time.. items was exactly as described. the cellphone did not work. the scream was damaged. it looked like used bought on feb 15 and the charger cable is already not working. can\\'t find a manufacturer replacement charger cable. still a great phone but useless if it can\\'t charge. the phone arrived on time and was working, however, the item is posted as used very good bu the phone came with many scratches/ small dings on the back of the phone on the colored part. i have t admit the screen was perfect without a scratch so that was great. i gave it a lower rating because it made me believe it would be good as new with maybe one scratch. also, there is no sim card in the phone so you can\\'t activate it until you go to the store and sometimes it may take some pushing to get the employees at the store to give you the card because they don\\'t get commission on the small card. i would recommend this to anyone. i got the white iphone 5 and it\\'s amazing for a certified refurbished phone. i don\\'t usually write reviews but this product is so good i had to excellent update: i failed to notice the part in the manual that says this phone typically needs a new battery annually. i also found the apn settings online when i got this phone for my husband. he went to a different at&t store to get the password, and the guy there was not able to help. it\\'s nice to look like a genius to your spouse once in a while:name: attapn: wap.cingularproxy: <leave in blank>port: <leave in

is responsive, and we downloaded recorded videos to our computer with the usb cable easily (once we figured it out). the user manual leaves a lot to be desired in terms of detailed instructions, but most of our questions were answered online anyway. there was a light-duty cover that came with the phone, but i had already gotten the heavier one recommended on amazon. i\\'ve dropped the phone a couple of times with no damage occurring. as to the wrinkles....i couldn\\'t text pictures until i went into the at&t store, and they plugged in their password under the access point names setting. then it was fine. i also noticed that using data is like a power-vacuum on the battery, it\\'s dead in a couple of hours. but i don\\'t use it often (only while traveling), and i try to limit/disable the apps to preserve the battery life. talk and text alone will allow the battery to last 2 days in my experience. for my needs, it\\'s like i just got $500 in my pocket by choosing this phone. excellent good product , i recommend this seller 100 % thanks to amazon i got my money back. the home would overheat to the point of shutting down for no apparent reason other than being boiling hot this is the worse phone everyday, it freezes and the tabs will stuck on a letter. don\\'t buy it. excellent cellphone! excellent service nice phone. it arrived broken i didn\\'t hear the voice of income calls and i can\\'t repair or return because was a gift for other people which returned to me late it is a peice of junk it run out of battery and i charge it and did nit work anymore i need to return it hi all,i am writing at the following: last 18-01-2015 i bought a lg g2 mini phone. what is my surprise the phone is not working properly the application message. i can\\'t send and receive message, show the following mistake \"unfortunately the application will close\", further to this, the main camera shows the same error \"unfortunately the application will close\". browsing this error in internet forums i find that is a problem of android 4.4.2 system.in this case that i can make this phone cost $ 205 and i can not find the way to work properly in internet forums mention that i debeo change the systema 4.4.2 on the other. but is an original new phone, why i have to install a modified version to fix this problem?, these applications are basic in android system send and receive message and take pictures those which can not be performed.waiting for your comments about it.regardsluis serrano i am very disappointed at how it turned out to work. it is a nice phone, personally i think it was over priced but i bought it anyway. it worked okay for just a week; brand spanking new phone so i am not sure how this can happen. it heats up for no reason, freezes up where you cant even turn it off. it goes off by itself after a couple of hours and it comes back up when ever it feels like it. i am miss some very important phone calls due to that. i keep all my meetings and poc and locations of them on my phone so when it started acting like that, it made my daily schedule very difficult to tract and manage sometimes. i need it change. i was looking for an upgrade phone from my iphone 4 and wanted to go back to an android phone. i use prepaid no contract service by straight talk. i wanted a phone that was going to be heavy on my pockets. i was searching on amazon for phones when the blu studio phones came up. i have never heard of blu studio so i was curious. i had read several reviews from customers and was please the majority of the reviews i read were very favorable. i decided to buy the blue studio 5.0 hd in pink. i have had it now for about two weeks and i love it. setting up the phone was easy. i just popped my slim card in from my iphone and i was up and running. i love the large screen, great volume, excellent picture taking and 4g speed. i have no complaints. my 19 year old daughter was also in the market for a new phone and recommended the blu studio 5.0 hd and she loves it. she said she couldn\\'t be happier and we both love the affordable cost. we are so glad we didn\\'t spend a lot of money on one of the other top cellphones on the market. i will definitely buy a another blu studio in the future when i\\'m ready four another upgrade again. i would like to try the blu windows phones it looks like a good phone. excellent.... great device minor wear, looks brand new. months after purchase i have had no problems at all with the phone. the phone came in perfect condition. i\\'m satisfied is a very goog product nice case broke within 2 weeks. great if youre not going to open it a lot. good didn\\'t care for this. hard to setup with at&t...at least in my area. bluf: phone is as promised and strongly recommend if it has what you need. no learning curve on using it.i ordered one of these for my daughter originally and she fell in love with it and so did her friends. she originally wanted a iphone, but i didn\\'t want to switch carriers an didn\\'t want to risk a getting one for her that someone unlocked as we don\\'t live in the same area... now this is in no way like the iphone, but it does all she really wanted, text, internet (infrequently) and most of all a touch screen with a qwerty keypad. she love the phone so much that i played with it and fell in love with it myself! my work has tmobile and is very cheap with getting us the actual phone, for that mater i have had the same work phone for over 6 years! not only was the battery for my work phone bad, i could not find a replacement battery as it was so old. so i bought one of these cookie unlocked phones and i like it almost as much as my personal nokia smartphone that i paid twice as much for! phone is very user friendly, except for setting up some of the features such as internet, but once that is done you\\'re done. so far i have had no trouble with either of the two phones and so far have exceeded my (and my daughters) expectation. love this case, i wanted purple and got it, fits my phone great! updated from nexus 5 to this and love it. the screen size is perfect. not to big, not to small. fits in hand well. the bottons on back seem weired at first, but i live a lot now, after month of use. camera is great. the phone works great on straight talk service. i like the build in wireless charging option. i use the same charger as i did on n5. it shipped with kitkat, but with in min of wifi connection, it updated to lollipop. as far as phones go it is pretty nice easy to use .. however buyer beware it is considered a smartphone and requires a data package.. not just a texting one.. the sprint people at first told my daughter it didn\\'t but they changed my plan to data so upon deeper investigation i found out that it was in fact a smartphone.. so as far as phones go it is a great buy for the money but only if you want a full data package. i was really surprised because it is not only good, but it is really excelent. it easily compares to the iphones two of my sons have and the samsungs my grandchildren have. item received was not exactly as advertised, thankfully the seller promptly refunded my money upon return. crap. the phone we received couldn\\'t be activated because verizon showed it was already activated by someone else. had to return it for a refund. received it today it is simple and seems good enough as a backup phone i\\'ll post in a couple of years to see how it withstood the power of time!update #1: one week after purchase, the phone has a pretty bad sound quality people hear me badly and i hear them badly also, this is only a backup phone and only costs 20 bucks but if call quality is the most important aspect on a backup phone for you you should look elsewhere. the battery life is insane though and that\\'s mainly what i wanted so i\\'m not docking any more stars. overall a good phone for the price. there is no way to get rid of unwanted menu icons and the phone call quality is not what i expect from nokia but the phone is durable. my daughter loved it. great christmas present. great! have had posh microx for a day now. it is not going to replace your full size android phone. no app drawer, cannot uninstall some apps. no weather widget available except native, closest city 50miles away. that being said, amazing for the 30$ i paid. i have lots of smartphones. doesn\\'t compare with my note or fire phone. would say it is about as good as my alcatel c1. other than the pros or cons of being super small. i would say its a solid low end android phone. my phone was not factory unlocked! incredible performance for price, on par with phones costing $100\\'s more. use it everyday for work- emails, photo docs, scanning, emailing docs back to office, just a beast, a workhorse. octa-core performance never lets me down, no overheating. call quality & sound awesome for price point. was looking at s6 also at the time, but decided to save my money & go with zte. i\\'m completely satisfied gave this smartphone to my father for his birthday. it meet all his expectations and even pull out some surprises for him. i can even dare to say that, for a tech junkie, it can pull the trick pretty well. i never has an android phone and was pretty much horrified to switch from my iphone... well, i will never go back to iphone or any other phone for that matter. blu vivo5 had the most beautiful packaging and it\\'s an incredible phone all around. i am using it now for a few months and have not had one issue, it\\'s super fast and of an excellent quality... all that for 200$. very happy customer, thank you. :) amazing phone. a month ago i bought 5 posh titan hd e550a for me and my family. i can say that five phones are working great. it works fast, the camera is nice, and it has a very good memory. i am very happy with my purchase, and all i can do is recommend and give five stars to this phone. this phone is beyond expectation. i am enjoying the phone tremenduously. i have already bought another one for my brother in africa. i\\'m hoping it\\'s going to work well for him as it is working for me. the phone speed is superb. i can recommend this phone to my friends. in my opinion it beat iphone any time, lots of free downloads and many more good stuffs. i am not a tech person but i know any tech will enjoy this phone like any other expensive phones. skeptical but did my research.... all i can say is wow! just like my galaxy note 2 but without the pen & bigger. battery lasts for 2.5 days. fyi: transfer your contacts via bluetooth. feel like i have an ipad mini in my hand. love it!!! battery is non-removeable but replaceable by company! i plugged my sim att card in & bam, i\\'m in business. huawei promises a lollipop upgrade... we\\'ll see! either way, i\\'m very pleased! my 64gb sd card i bought did not work. excelent this phone was not unlocked. i bought this phone because i didn\\'t feel like paying $800 for a \"high end\" phone that pretty much does the same thing as this phone does. it does everything i need it to do and it has 64gb of internal memory which is plenty for all of my 30 apps that i install and for my pictures. it comes stock with android 6.x which is all i need really. i\\'m also pretty happy with the battery life though i wish the charging was a little faster. one of my favorite things about the phone is the lack of bloatware, which i have been use to being a samsung customer for the past 4 years. i\\'ve never had a problem with the fingerprint scanner and it works pretty flawlessly. the only slight problem that i have with the phone is that once in a while, it freezes up. not sure why but it usually takes a couple of minutes to unfreeze. aside from that, this is an amazing phone and i\\'m glad it\\'s available for this price. bonus: it comes with a headphone jack and it won\\'t explode on you. excellent well i don\\'t have the phone yet but right now ill give it a 5star! i hope it was worth my money update 4/3/16 phone works perfectly for to update... 9/27/16 the screen is very lose pops in and out with the slightest drop. dropping the score 3star i had some problems with the battery charging and also dying way before 1%. sent it back, battery was replaced. it still acts a little strange with the battery life at times and just connecting to charger. it doesn\\'t connect right away. have to plug and un-plug from phone jack/wall etc. until it connects. over night, i got a line going through half of my screen. top is normal and bottom is darker. not sure how that happened while sleeping. i have had the phone in an otterbox since day one. never had any issues like this with a iphone before. battery charge gets worse and worse. don\\'t recommend. paid $800 only to get a fake iphone!first of all, the charging animation is not apple\\'s at all. second, the silence button is crooked. third, the phone was used from when i opened the box, even forgetting the fact this is not an iphone. you can obviously tell as well this iphone is fake: i mean, look at the grammar. apple or any company wouldn\\'t do anything like this, and this doesn\\'t look like stock ios. the reason i got this case is the storage compartment. it works as described. wife loves it! the add said it was unlocked and the fact is that i still had to pay extra to someone else to really unlock it and be able to use it this phone is marred by unacceptable bluetooth performance. it literally drops my bluetooth headset when i put it in my pants pocket! on the plus side, the sound and speaker phone functionality is quite good, as other reviewers have mentioned. it also is not an exceptionally rugged phone as the screen broke after a fall from less than 3 feet. i bought this product, but this don\\'t carry a memory card. and i read has 8 gb of memory internal. nothing except the low light camera needs improvement. this is a beast of a device.on top of that, zte had been providing monthly updates so far... that\\'s better than some of the mainstream flagships! excelent great it\\'s an absolute steal at this price for how feature rich this phone is. favorably compares to $400-500 devices. the phone is really amazing. it is fast and has it all as it was shown on apple event. i\\'m very very satisfied with my iphone 7. awesome job!!!! i will be doing more business here!!!!!! worked no problem.. but the notifications came through blank, txt and phone calls worked perfect.. battery lasted all day. just keep in mind this is the first generation and can use some updating.. that is the reason i returned this item.. not too bad a product. after about a decade, again, it was time for a new replacement phone.oddly, the one received was weird in many regards, e.g., motorola was displaying upside down...a quick call later and instantly the problem was resolved, e.g., customer service credited me back for the purchase and, to my surprise, said to throw away the phone rather than ship it back to them.i am still impressed with how thorough and expeditious the customer service was!instead of leaving me with a bad impression, even now, months later, i am still smiling at the memory of the great customer service received! it worked for a week then it started saying no service i bought a new sim card and it did the same so i got rid of it fine excellent seller will buy again. it is perfect this phone . first time that i bought a phone online and i had a very good experience . it\\'s in very good condition and i got the phone next day . the only thing it\\'s that on the back doesn\\'t say \"galaxy s7 edge\" a fantastic battery life. read on reviews about this, but until i actually purchased and saw for myself, had trouble believing. a 1 starrer..!! this is why -1. first, and most important - the phone would turn off every now and then without any apparent reason! this is a horrible thing to happen as i would suddenly discover that my phone is turned off, and i am not sure for how long it has been off and how many calls i have missed! and that\\'s not all; here comes the even worse part - most of the times you cannot restart the phone without first plugging in to it\\'s charger (even though it is fully charged)!! now if you are outside, or do not have the charger with you, just pretend you belong to the pre-cell-phone era till you get back home! grrrr....2. the in-built gps never worked. it will keep trying locate you and finally fail! that means all those funky apps which use gps data are not for you!3. thought updating the firmware might help resolve the issues. tried doing that and surprise - it failed! it gave me a message that this phone is not eligible for firmware update!! great!4. tried to live with this \"phone\" for about a month after which i gave up and decided to return it. then comes the final surprise! i tried to \\'factory-reset\\' the phone, and that failed too!! i tried several times in many different ways, but with same result - it was unable to factory reset itself. obviously i could not return the phone without factory resetting it as it had my google account configured in it and there was no way to remove it without factory resetting it.so there it lies, at the corner of my room, gathering dust, while my $140 is enjoying in somebody else\\'s pocket!! love it i got this watch on amazon about 3 or four months ago be aust i thought it was simpler to the apple watch... but boy was i wrong!!!!!, instead save your almost $30 and buy the mtk2502c it\\'s a fake version of the apple watch, it\\'s water proof, has a heart rate sensor and looks exactly the same as the apple watch and its only $74 almost brand new, it has a really small bump easy to miss. great phone, complete with cables, deliver on time. thanks! this \"smart\" watch is not worth the money. not only do the functions not work properly, the app needed to connect with my iphone does not work. the built in app scan failed out, and since the instructions were lacking, i had to search for similar apps, all of which did nothing!luckily, this was bought for a 9-year old to see if she could be responsible enough for a smart watch. within 24 hours, she accidentally submerged it in water and gave it a quick death. such a waste of money. firstly:when i began unpacked, box don\\'t looked like new.secondly:why this cell phone doesn\\'t have ota update? i entered to menu about phone, and what i saw? no update center. this cell phone must had this option. i tried update to lollipop and i didn\\'t. also tried used pc suite and i got the same, plus error message.thirdly:battery is very sucks. 5 or 6 hours and cell phone just gonna die.fourthly:screen, when i touched screen they had some defect. after a lifetime of samsung, htc and lg smartphones, i decided to take a chance on the zte axon - my first unlocked device and first zte phone. i am using it on at&t\\'s network. after reading forums, product reviews and doing comparisons, i jumped in to see what the hype was about.let me start by saying this thing is smoking fast - it has a snapdragon 810 chip set with 4 gb ram, which means that flipping through screens, watching movies, playing with the camera/video and even gaming has been great. this is more memory than i had in my last device (lg g3) and it shows. i have not yet had a hang, stutter or anything. one reviewer mentioned the phone heating up. i personally have not experienced this in my usage and i have been throwing a lot of stuff at it. this thing is fast!i got the pfthalo blue color with gold trim and it is stunning. i receive comments on it regularly as it looks unlike most other boring black devices out there. the phone is metal and feels very solid - hard to believe that i paid what i did for it. it has a mono speaker but the volume is loud and sound is clear. i would have preferred stereo speakers but have used this for conference calls on speakerphone and it hasn\\'t caused an issue yet. i get the impression that zte put a ton of effort into the axon and it does indeed feel like a flagship offering with lots of attention paid to details, textures, components, etc. just what i am looking for in a cool device that i want to use every day and feel good doing it.as a few other reviewers have noted, the camera on the axon is excellent. it gives me great options like slow motion, multi-exposure, panorama, hdr, time lapse and more along with a bevy of manual f stop and camera controls if i want to tweak it to my experience. i can even adjust the depth of field after my photo is taken, something that gives me a great look if i forget to adjust ahead of time. i did not notice any aberrations or color issues when i transferred them to my computer and blew them up. video is sharp and fluid as well.it may sound trite, but the screen is just flat-out gorgeous. great contrast, viewing angle, etc. - what everyone should be looking for. colors were bright and accurate and everything i did on it looked great, from netflix to web to games. seriously, i am impressed with this screen. my wife\\'s samsung showed colors brighter but they were almost unnatural to a degree because of the oled screen. i prefer realism, just as i intended when i take photos or watch movies.my axon pro came with 32gb memory but no microsd slot. at first i thought this may be an issue, but the more i thought about it, it\\'s easiest just to back things up to the cloud or on my computer and when i looked at all the photos and music i already had loaded onto the phone, i still had tons of room left. so this is not an issue for me.i\\'ll end by saying this has changed my entire outlook on zte as a company. i used to think of them for prepaid low-end phones over the years but the axon changes everything. i have recommended this phone to family members and friends and i remind them that it does virtually everything their more expensive phones do but at a fraction of a price. i paid only $450 for all of this!sorry, samsung, i am done paying $800 (or more) for a phone - never again. well done, zte! you\\'ve gained a new fan. it is a very user friendly phone my husband, who is not tech savvy at all, can really get along with. excellent just as described. due to my mistake, i had to send it back. i ordered the iphone 6. best value i could find. great customer support. wonderful to work with. excellent phone, exceeded all my expections. one of the main concerns i had while buying this phone was the battery. but to my surprise it is lasting upto 3 days. awesome display and camera. this is the best phone i ever had. the xperia zl is a great piece of technology. fast processor, excellent hd screen, reasonable battery life.alas, for reasons unclear to me at present, the phone died within 60 days of purchase.when i say \"died\", please allow me to be more specific. i\\'m fairly tech-savvy, and do not remotely give up at the first sign of trouble. alas, this phone beat me.seemingly at random one afternoon, the phone\\'s touch-screen stopped responding to input. so...that pretty much means the phone is, for all intents and purposes...dead. i attempted the following basic solutions:1) factory reset2) \"repair\" option on the sony bridge / desktop app3) reinstall os / flash osunfortunately, none of these worked. the phone, even after reinstalling the drivers and firmware, continue to be unresponsive on the touch-screen.i spoke to sony\\'s warranty department. and unfortunately, since i\\'m in europe at the moment where the specific lte model is not sold...i\\'m basically out of luck. no suggestions from sony, other than to ship it back to a regional repair site in north america.so in the end...i spend a good $600 or so...on a phone that functioned...for about 60 days.unfortunately, sony\\'s entire z-line of products seems to be plagues with several \"instant death\" problems. unfortunately what i experienced is not uncommon. just dig around google a bit; you\\'ll see.so...if you\\'d like to pay $10/day for a phone on average...that will become a brick within 60 days...well, look no further. charger did not work, had to purchase this as a local supplier, but phone works well. great phone but the battery pack was faulty and i had to purchase a new phone. i love the durability i just wish the product wasn\\'t messed up. i have no problems with it so far. i\\'ve been using it intensely. i\\'m going from app to app and there\\'s no performance loss at all. it\\'s got ample of ram. i never ran out of ram yet. it\\'s always somewhere from 2gb to 500mb free. the gps is lightning quick. when i need it i just turn it on and i use google maps or waze and my location is already pinpointed. the battery is not bad at all. on a typical day of reading news, checking emails, updating apps, watching youtube, playing games, and texting/calling, i end the day around 20% - 30%. if you get a case with a screen cover with a circle cutout, you get to use utilities like a flashlight, camera, a clock, a calendar, and checking the weather right from the circle cutout, which i use a lot to check time and to use the flashlight. and finally, it comes pre-installed with a bunch of utilities like a power management app that allows me to set a time where i can switch the phone to power save mode, which saves battery. i set it from 11pm to 6am while i sleep. i\\'m not that kind of person who charges their phone at night because i don\\'t really need to. it comes with a fast charger and it takes about 30 - 45 minutes to fully charge then i go to work. nice phone , a lot of phone for the money . works great on cricket . just order yourself a cricket starter kit her on amazon for $10, plug in the sim and you are good to go . be sure and get the cricket app from the app store . would buy it again great price on the best case on the market. this is a replacement case for a black one i received when getting the phone. 1 1/2 years ago. that case is still working fine except the access piece that covers charging port broke off after several thousand opening and shutting to charge. this phone is just as described. great value for money. extremely happy with this purchase. only one word describes it, awesome! i like nice and neat product. i placed a t-mobile sim card and it started working nicely.. so far i am very happy with this phone. i hope will last longer than my last samsung captivate (lasted 2 months) before going crazy. (the phone of course).i am still configuring all the apps and haven\\'t tried 3g yet. i\\'ll post when done.when i plugged it in on my usb port, it inmediatly, through kies, did an automatic software update and it was done perfectly.so far, very happy with this phone. it was broken so easily beautiful,fast and useful phone. the international version seems to have some issues connecting to t-mobile lte in the us. i get much lower speeds and less lte connectivity with this phone than i did with my old nexus 5. i have not tried to make many calls yet, but the normal cell reception also seems very weak (only one or two bars, where i think my nexus would have 2-3 bars).i am going to try returning this one and picking up a us version, hopefully that fixes the problem.... otherwise a pretty slick phone huge phone!!! i like it. happy with this purchase. thank you i am having issue with the browsing speed using my data. new. works. what postpaid means, i have no idea. but for the money it\\'s a good replacement phone. ordered my phone after looking at for a couple days,am very impressed by the quality of the phone, arrived on time and am loving it i think its better than an iphone, it gives your more memory space. it has face recognition to unlock the phone. it also has features that an iphone doesn\\'t have plus a big screen than an iphone. summary overall, i\\'m happy with it, except for slightly weak signal.i\\'ve had it over a year of rough use so far. a great deal for the price. (note: looks like the price has increased since i bought it)- worked fine when i inserted my att sim card with no extra tweaking.- good battery life- good camera (but it sucks in low light).- good large screen (but not great in bright sunlight)- browses web and plays video smoothly, runs multiple apps with no glitches.- battery cover feels flimsy, but this not noticeable once the include protective cover is on it. (but definitely not waterproof even with protective cover)- sound quality even at max is a little quiet, both on calls and video playback. but only a problem if i\\'m in a loud room.- my only major complaint is that in weak-reception areas call reception and internet are the worst of any phone i\\'ve ever had.my partner also has a blu phone (of a different model) and she often has full internet when i have none.- in areas with strong signal, its totally fine, and it gets good wifi reception.-the touch screen is oversensitive. (turns single taps into double taps)-the power button is in a spot where i keep accidentally hitting it when i don\\'t mean to. (but that might just be me.)-it arrived with almost no pre-loaded apps which to me is a plus.-i recommend ditching the photo editing software that came with it and installing snapseed instead (free, versatile, and ad-free). had a bit of trouble with the original one, but with the help of their customer support all came out well and i am really impressed with this watch and what it can do. i don\\'t have a data plan so can\\'t get on the internet with it, but as small as the face is a lot of what i would find on the internet would be too small or chopped up to read. it is so easy to use, installing contacts and phone numbers and i even mastered taking a picture. haven\\'t tried the video yet.i am in my 80\\'s and got this for safety\\'s sake and really do feel safe with the ability to call 911 if i needed help. don\\'t have to carry my big smart phone that is smarter than me, so i don\\'t feel inadequate now.if it doesn\\'t work when you get it work with the cs folks. they will figure out what you are trying to question them about and help. i returned one that didn\\'t seem to work, they mailed another that got lost in the christmas rush, then sent me another and it works well, i even understand how to use it. just what i needed. and so glad i persisted and so did their customer service folks. the product was not water proof & did not specify arrived as expected. very good shape ,will replace old broken phone . old phone was going to cost over one hundred dollars to repair extremely good!! good good stuff but so far can\\'t get 4g lte and the ring tone is not working, the rest of the notifications sounds are ok, only the incoming calls does not make any sound at all. so i guess is a issue. not a bad watch! but does not do half of what it says in the description or have half the apps! the audio is not loud enough to hear and the ear buds are huge! but this watch is good for a first smartwatch really good phone. very responsive and the picture quality is great. lightweight and sleekdidn\\'t know if i\\'d like a windows phone, but it\\'s a good purchase although i have an iphone 4 now, this was a great phone! it was small but i loved it. i recommend it for young preteens. excellent hi everyone i\\'m from united states new york city and only work with t mobile but it will work with at&t but phone/yes texting/yes internet/no offer some great protection from drops and scratches. if your hands are wet liquid will wick under and up the screen protector. difficult to take off without good fingernails. i have used many otterboc defenders and my devices always look brand new when i upgrade/trade in. works in venezuela great i purchased this for my samsung s5, i love the purple and gun metal color combination. the protector screen is built right in. this was an excellent buy. it was easy to install. i would recommend this to anyone that wants to protect their cell phone in case of accidents. perfect, the cellphone run really well i houp works in another country.any way thank\\'s. not a global 4g lte band, don\\'t suport (b3)i bought this phone because i thought it was really unlocked 4g lte world is global and even 3g umts is only ( 2g) gsm quad band unlocked love it i have had this phone for 3 days now and i found out that you have to be very careful when downloading talkback app from google play store. i downloaded this app and i couldn\\'t scroll in my settings menu any longer. once that happened i couldn\\'t scroll down to reset my phone. i looked all over the internet and finally found a reference to my problem and when you open your settings menu and you can\\'t scroll it after downloading this app what you have to do is swipe two fingers diagonally across the face of your phone. when i first tried this i was swiping across and up and down but by accident i just tried it any old way and when i did it diagonally on the settings page it started scrolling. i thought this might help some of you if you run into this problem. this is the only problem i have had so far. i gave this phone 5 stars because i should have checked ahead of time before downloadingany apps. also i want to emphasize that this phone s4010u uses a standard size sim card and not a micro sim card. i found this out through consumer cellular.update: this phone is really a good working phone. i have had no problems with it except the app mentioned in my first review. this phone does everything that any smartphone is suppose to do. i really like it.update: october 24. this phone is still working very good and the battery charge last me a day. no problems with this phone. good product nice phone, price and customer service. but device started to give problem with the power button after few weeks. nothing that couldn\\'t be fix but it takes away the satisfaction of thinking i made such an amazing deal. the phones were old not updated software but were unlocked bb needed two hours with me to update the software and get spanish on them. the charges were not oem and two blew up when plugged in and almost caused a fire we threw the third away. but from someone esle the price was $20 cheaper than new and not worth it. excelente buy this product for christmas gift to my daughter. it did not work. i do not recomiento. first of many purchases by amazon that something is wrong. completely disappointed. my daughter is sad. i want my dollars back to buy another. worked great ! was easy to get on a prepaid card and switched carriers with no fuss. cool watch ! junk phone and tried to return it and said its been past 30 days i think you should have longer than that now im stuck with this junky phone nice love this phone good i purchased this new palm pre 2 because no one else sells it and i had to update my old palm pre 2 because it just wasn\\'t working right anymore. so far i\\'m loving my new palm pre 2. i wish this company was still in existence because i prefer the webos so much better. you can\\'t go wrong buying this product from amazon, it\\'s great delivery, packaging and service. exelent excelent god bless i am very happy with this purchase , fast shipping a product of excellent quality, very good seller one of the best phones i\\'ve ever had, is my first htc and i\\'m very happy with it, excellent in quality and price. good hd screen 5 inches, with a very vivid colors. very nice in design, excellent materials used, good performance with games and applications ... but not everything is perfect, since it only has 8gb of internal memory and only the system occupies 4gb, and when downloading and update the applications more used by all we have 2.2gb, of course can be solved with sd memory but only for certain applications. i would have loved to have 16 gb of memory and a battery of 3000mah, but for the price that has this equipment i think very reasonable all the features it has.i do not regret having this phone and from now on i stay with the htc devices. ordered this phone as a replacement for the same model until my contract expires and i can get a new one. seller confirmation said delivery could take up to 7 days. seller sent out the phone within hours of receiving the order and i had the phone the next day. phone looks better than described was able to transfer data from the old one to the new one with no problems. highly recommend this seller i dont think this is completely unlock. because i have to try 2 different companies to make it work. and still its not working properly, sometimes when im in the phone the other personcant hear me or turn off by itself or gets to hot i received a broken phone. i have already sent it back and it was received. i just had to find a different phone that would work with my service provider. i love this phone. it does exactly what i want, which is make and receive phone calls. the e-ink screen is very easy to see. the battery lasts a long time. text messaging works fine, but i rarely do it. i chose to buy it directly from amazon, since it was pretty cheap and returning it would be easy if necessary. the volume and clarity is good. the build quality feels good. it is small and easily fits comfortably in my pocket. there was no \"default language\", instead when i turned it on it asked me to choose between spanish, portuguese, and english. documentation for it easy to find on the motorola website and the wikipedia.i have no complaints. it is exactly what i expected and wanted. not satisfied if u like 6s and u dont like its size, get se great my phone do not be quiet when it is in silent mode especially when i take a pic.in addition, they gave me low quality earphones. i purchased this unlocked samsung focus i917 with buying it and definitively it is a great option to save money because offer the most important features that any expensive smartphones must have, but it cost less than 50% of them. its designs is very attractive, runs wifi very fast, sound of speakers is great and loud, etc. i updated the windows operative system (os) thru the zune program installed in my pc without any problem. now i can get more apps and some phone functions are now performed in a more efficient way. i know that some persons have concerns because they believe that updating the os could \"lock\" the phone. in my experience the \"unlock condition\" was not impacted and the phone is now running with the last phone windows version. i am using this phone with a mexico sim card (telcel) and is functioning perfect. i also tested it with a sim card of usa and worked fine too. i think it is a great option for the cell phone users in mexico and anywhere.... i think it is not necessary to purchase smartphones of $ 500 or $ 600 dlls.... this samsung has the same powerful performance of the expensive smartphones at a very attractive price. horrible phone now. i worked properly for 3 months but now i am not able to turn on the phone as it will turn off automatically. also unable to charge this phone. every one should avoid this product. i bought it used but.... i only used it few months because does not functioned anymore, it seems like dead. don\\'t accept reparation .to bad! sorry! i got the c905a at&t locked phone. (i will get at&t to unlock this phone in two years when its contract is up.)the phone and camera is fun.the instructions are deplorable. someone fired any talent they might have had in the instruction manual department for sure! maybe this is a result of meddling by \"the new at&t\", i dont know but someone made an unholy mess of the owner\\'s manual. undefined terms, sloppy wording that is inaccurate, features not mentioned and other features with major subfeatures missing. for example there is no mention of mp3 anywhere in the manual and yet you can load songs with ease and the phone will play them. instructions for operation of the volume control is wrong. reference to \"hands free\" which term they dont bother to define: \"plug in the hands free\" to make an antenna for the fm.for the big money they ask for this phone i am disappointed. good the cell phone that we purchase was a great deal ! yeah there was some starches on it ! it does the job which highly needed for texting! it is a lifeline support for a love one ! who needs to keep in touch ! so thank you great phone, exactly as in the photos. beautiful. great product ! really looked like new ! am a very happy customer i think i got a new one 😂 i like the could it\\'s true to the picture. takes a little getting use to, not quite as user friendly as i\\'d hoped but really worth the price very happy with this phone and its features. great cell phone! the phone works good but it was not the color i chose pedi white as in the photo that you offer me to get blue sky from white to blue sky is much difference really was not what i expected or better is not what pedi the phone is very instable after 30 days. constantly drop signals. have to restart it multiple times a day. i tried to contact the seller and got no reply back. too bad i can\\'t return or exchange it. phone is defective, nobody can hear me on the other end of the phone. i was told this phone was inspected, but obviously not!!!plus they want me to pay for shipping return! rip off horrible. battery life and charging system sucks. major glitches in software i am really dissapointed with this phone. i was advertised as new, but was refurbished. i can hardly hear the person talking. after receiving the phone i had to pay a specialty store 25.00 to enable the phone to send and receive pics. excellente this purchase was not made for reasons beyond our control. thank you. very nice phone good it is very good smartphone. good price excelent camera and very fast this item arrived defective me, and as it has lost money guarantee. i bought two (2) and with different vendors and both arrived damaged. i recommend not buy. it is a scam .. i bought this phone and gave it to my niece for christmas and the button with the number 8 on it was in the 7 spot and the 8 spot. i was not happy about it and felt like it looked like i bought a cheap phone. device is good pass my expectations of what i was looking for its a great phone and the camera is great it works fine its just a good deal muy bien all perfect!!thankregard i bought this to use with the lebara france prepaid sim card. it never worked. it would not recognize that a sim card was inserted. next time i\\'ll pay the extra to have my smart phone activated in europe. this cheapo cell phone is not useful for anything other than a phone call. the phone is fine, the delivery was fast but the charger was defect and the package didn’t include the lg headphone phone was delivered on time... all the features are great....i\\'d definitely recommend an buy again an again... thanks blu lg optimus p970 (white) : unlocked international version 4.0 inches android gsm phone-it has muffled noise, the receipient of this phone can hardly hear anything when she is called on whatsapp calling,and she reports that the camera has never worked and all the buttons at the bottom of the screen never worked. unfortunately this phone is overseas, can i retrieve & return it? did not work does not even come ready to use needs sim card and also sd card. product is really good. but i had order and return a device to get a fully functioning device. the first device had a speaker problem. i love this samsung galaxy s5 really everythingis fine & nothing problem, even the price is fair. uhm... i just got this today and its been \"updating\" for the past 3 hours and is still at 0% and says it failed initialization.....very displeased.. no me gustó works great! hardly any lag and it has lost of room for downloads. great buy for overseas; would buy again! not too bad a product. very satisfied never regret buying this product i love the phone but when plug up to charge it freezes up and will not charge i sent a message saying if you can send me a new connector i will replace it as i did repairs on phone\\'s for 10 years it is a ale_l23 version, not ale-l04 version!!! purchased for daughter and she is very pleased with it. good price and arrived in a timely manner. really nice watch, works well when paired with my galaxy avant. however, i just got it yesterday and the screen cracked. is there a warranty on this? todo bien con este teléfono, envio en un tiempo justo, perfectas condiciones, mucha responsabilidad y mis saludos desde mi patria linda venezuela product not working well product just stop working want even turn on matt every expectation shipped quickly got here well and was easy to set up this is a good buy brand new works pefectly...love it i\\'ll skip the detailed review as there are already numerous ones of those. this is one of the best valued phones on the market, however 3 weeks after receiving mine it automatically went into \"guest mode.\" guest mode is annoying because you can\\'t view your pictures, see call logs, and probably numerous other things i never discovered. there is no setting called guest mode so don\\'t waste your time trying to find it, ie- there is no way to turn this mode off. i know this because i just got off the phone with blu. it took me 4 phone calls and finally reaching a supervisor to get a fix. they e-mail you a .apk file which does fix the problem. till this is fixed however i\\'d leave the 3 stars simply because all 3 technicians solution was for me to do a hard reset to get out of guest mode, took supervisor intervention to actually solve this. pro\\'s: excellent camera resolution. clear calls soft keypad (even though the small keys may not be the best for people fingers) activate the flashlight with the simple touch of a button has apps ability to add picture of contacts and you can scroll through them on the home screen. free voice guided navigationcon\\'s: notification icons are so small the ringer volume cannot be increased/decreased by pressing the side volume buttons alone; you must go into the menu to lower the volume or press the little \"music key\", but then there are only two options by pressing that button. not nearly as many apps or the same apps as those found in the android market when playing the radio, the wired headset has to be connected in order for the radio to be heard through loudspeaker (speakerphone)overall, i think this phone is pretty good. i chose this phone because of the free navigation, the 5mp camera, and it was a close as i could get to an android phone without having the touch screen. android phones cost entirely too much for them to break so easily. if you\\'re looking for a basic phone with a few extras, i would highly recommend it. also i read on another review that someone put the phone doesn\\'t work on t-mobile\\'s 3g network. my pre=paid plan is through t-mobile and it\\'s 3g and it works just fine. i don\\'t find it in belgium. so although i am heavy with my phone. i love it. my iphone 5 is well protected. it is a very nice phone. great camera and display! light and it has a premium look. i highly recommend it! i purchase it as a gift for my son so i guess i will have to wait for his opinion on it this is the phone i wanted. it was not enough memory storage and i hate to delete app lot. i want to trade to 16gb from 8gb!! love the seller for selling it so cheap bets thing about it it was factory unlocked but what really special what that it had the old bootrom which meant i could have a untethered jailbreak on ios 6.0.1 came with everything except the cables and charger. ality of its very good seller. excellent. this is a great phone it meets my needs even bought 2 more for family members sent it back. it said it was straighttalk compatible but it wasn\\'t. good replacement phone without spending a lot of money. i bought this for my daughter since she had her s4 stolen. decent screen size and display and battery life. lacks eq setting so the music sounds kind of mono. great phone bought for my son and he really love no issues what so ever item arrived fast and complete. item matched description very well. thank you. looks good and worth for money omg all perfect so far i have been completely satisfied with the product. it was within two days everything in the phone is functioning completely well and up to date. i would recommend this other buyers this deserves its 5 stars. they\\'re very professional and nice. i was looking for photon q and find this product under market of \"photon q\" with photo with keyboard. i\\'m not sure if i got something wrong or if i made something wrong. anyway i\\'m very disappointed on my \"shopping result\". this phone works ok, only problem is i won\\'t use. returned the phone. didn\\'t like it. love it y\\'all really played me. my screen keeps freezing making my phone unresponsive to the touch (the finger id sensor still works).. and my home button doesn\\'t work! i promise if we don\\'t work out a reasonable deal, you\\'ll be hearing from my attorney very soon! easy to use, the voice is clear but when i put it in the speaker it is not loud. if you like to use the headset, the voice is great. the battery stay for a long time. the screen is clear to see.i don\\'t like the way the alarm work. after it finish ringing the first time, it doesn\\'t ring again unless i click snooze. i had older nokia and the alarm ring without keep clicking snooze. it worth the money. and easy to used. producto de gran calidad y muy economico, lo que buscaba me gusto mucho llego e perfecto estado, seguire comprando excelente usable memory is limited not alowing many apps or pictures. great phone for this price !! did the job so cheap! but it works! impossible to send or receive images. size ok, very weak metal frame. pen fell on it and it already put a dent in it.alot of useless chinese apps which you can\\'t get rid of, performance wise, it runs smoothly and without hesitation.even heavy gaming is no problem. startup is a little bit slow probably because of all the chinese junk starting up at the same time.i get a full day- day and a half out of one full charge. single loudspeaker loud enough but i would have expected dual speakers like on the 8 inch phab.4g only available on rogers canada, 3 g only on cricket, at&t.(those are the only carriers i use).good signal strengh throughout canada and the u.s. i can say for sure because i am a long distance trucker.pictures appear sharp enough, device is sufficiently bright and what i especially like about it is the power input on the bottom of the phone. shortly i bought this about 1 month ago, the ota update for android 6.0 came in.i do use this phone for receiving and sending docs back and forth, watching netflix and kodi on it, and printing and scanning.so far it hasn\\'t let me down yet. well worth the price. its good so far so good. i dislike not having colored message indicator lights. it came like new with charger and had no scratches. so far everything works fine. very happy all ok blu happy if u like 6s and u dont like its size, get se very good, excellent ive used windows phones since 2011, the first generation.... and this phone clearly is a winner, love the style, the design and the amazing pureview camera.the only problem ive had is that the phone arrived without the sim tray, but i contacted the seller and everything was agreed, he sent the sim tray and now im using the phone without a problem. phone works really well, didn\\'t expect that since i had never had a blu phone before. but overall i\\'m very happy with the product it arrived with a broken and scratched battery so i sent it right back! excellent it\\'s not that great it does work but your better off buying apple or samsung they r better but if u don\\'t want anything fancy this would be good for u the keyboard is very small so it\\'s hard to text on an it says to download the app don\\'t worry about downloading the app u can connect just through the bluetooth an the texting and calling will work i think it is hard to use but that is me good good enjoying it! i bought two of these. typical droid, but i have to address some obvious haters. first, screenshot works just fine. power and volume down button at the same time for a few seconds, done. bluetooth is not called bluetooth, that is true. it is called wht, and it works just fine also. paired up no problems with shower speaker and bt headphones. very light, large screen, 4g. what else do you want for 180. used prime and paid 3.99 for overnight and it got here the next morning. funny thing is it changes the name on amazon when you change the color from black to another color. calls it a tablet, but it is a phone. maybe some have issues with using kitkat, who knows. this is one of the worst phones i have ever had, it freezes up it shuts off and you have to remove battery to reset the phone it is a piece of crap, and i have only had it for 3 days. would not ever recommend or buy again. the phone does not work well, then i turned it on it goes crazy, i can not answer calls or messages, now after you restart i can not unlock it to access the phone functions. i do not know what to do. love it its all most been a year and phone is still good the phone is used... the phone screen freeze and have problem you can see on the screen rare button like watermark... they sell the phone in bad condition... terrible dont buy it...when i bought this pic doesnt appaer. the put pic of new phone... :( i originally wrote a good review for this seller because i received the phone so quickly and was able to activate it with no problem.fast forward 4 months, this phone is crap! it keeps powering off every 30 seconds. i contacted the seller battery assault and of course the 90 days is up. from day one when i plugged it in to charge i got messages that it wasn\\'t the correct battery for the phone. not sure what that is suppose to mean, then i would get messages that it wasn\\'t the right cable for the phone. i thought you could use any charger that fit, but i was using the original charger anyway. i will never buy another phone from them or anyone online. you definitely get what you pay for, roughly 4 months of use. not worth it. product did not work nice this cellphone is really amazing if you compare price with functionality, size, screen, apps and interface. excellent choice if you\\'re looking for something cheap and close to a smartphone. wife loves it i got this phone about a week ago and i have to say i am very impressed. the negative reviews intimidated me but i decided to make my own decision and buy it.the phone is fast, it hardly lags while watching videos or while i do many things at once. the display is beautiful. pictures are great too, but videos are not. but i don\\'t mind that. if i wanted very good video quality i would just buy a video camera. the thing that concerned me the most was speed and capability. well, it sure can handle it. i\\'ve used it to watch movies on netflix and i\\'ve had no problem. give it a try if you want and are not too picky or like me, you don\\'t have 500 dollars for a new galaxy. i think you will be satisfied. pretty good phone. no complaints a++ wonderful device. phone size,style and color is amazing exactly what u expect... but the lag in the screen is ridiculous and should be fixed asap...idk how the expect this phone to compete with other big market androids if the speed is not even close to be on the same level as any galaxy s3 or better android...its bout as slow as the note 1 besides needing a extra sim card and a blue tooth head phone this watch works great. the price is great to a lot less then the $ 200.00 that the other guys are asking. i was truly impressed when i first took it out of the box but i got over it in the first cpl hours. screen constantly glitches out, auto rotation for screen only works if you shake the piss out of it. i\\'m not returning it simply because i want the satisfaction of shooting it when my new phone comes in. very capable and user-friendly phone. it is under-rated out in the market, iv\\'e never quite got used to the iphone and droid style phones, there a little to fragile for my line of work. the samsung convoy is able to take a beating and still keeps on working and thats why like the basic flip phone. excelente i received my phone yesterday and it worked perfectly. i had a slight problem but the seller was fast to solve it!! it\\'s very very nice, buy it !!!! bien... tell me bout the warranty.. not too bad for the price! thanks i like it excellent phone, colorfull screen, it suprised me because i was not sure because of the ppi density, but i am satisfied, samsung has its magic. it is fast, i am still loading apps continues fast, so far. nokia e71 unlocked cell phone with 3.2 mp camera, 3g, media player, gps, wi-fi, microsd slot--u.s. version with warranty (gray)excellent celphone was just as described and did not tale long to arrive. everything was great!! qwerty keypad is miserable, the keypad appears to be lower than normal, and leads to s lot of typos. overall the phone works well and thanks to a recent android update the battery lasts alot longer. nothing compared to my old moto g though.the phone is a little buggy. for example the driving app (application meant to make using apps while driving easier) always turns on for no apparent reason. i turned it off in the settings but it still decides to come back and haunt me with it\\'s constant inconveniences. right in the middle of a text or something it will switch to driving mode and then to exit i must go back to the main screen. in most cases i\\'ll haveto exit driving mode 4 times before it lets me be and finish my text.another gripe is that texting is not very accurate and laggy at times.also the screen is a it large. i have normal sized hands and feel like i\\'m doing thumb yoga every app i use. this item arrived new in the box, with everything encluded. i first decided to buy the phone because it was relatively within my budget and i\\'ve never really been one for fancy phones. a couple weeks after i received it, the phone started acting funny. when i changed to a different screen, i\\'d notice that the screen i was on before would remain in the background forever, i kid you not! videos are not really clear, but sound quality is really good(louder than my laptop!) overall, if you dont have another choice, it\\'ll do. but i don\\'t see it as a good quality long-term cellphone. i\\'ve only had this phone 3 days so i will review as much as possible. it seems to b fast i don\\'t have many apps on it so there is no reason for it to b slow right now. when im talking on the phone the ear speaker makes a cracking noise but i can still hear. i have several different bluetooth headsets some work with this phone some don\\'t. i\\'m charging my lg headset right now im hoping it will work. ok now the fact that it only comes with a silicone case and u can\\'t buy cases. i read a review that someone posted it said to order a case for a samsung mega 6.3. i did some comparing b4 i ordered and figured out the hard cases will not work. i ordered one of the wallet cases for the mega 6.3. this phone will fit in the silicone case attached to the wallet case but the only things that line up correctly is the camera not the flash and the back speaker. so i got creative and took a razor cut the case off of the wallet case and hot glued the case that came with the phone to the wallet case... perfect fit!! and while i had the razor cut the hole for the flash. it\\'s a great phone for the price! the batery is bad and this phone is hot with talk, tanks the item was not working at all it is very good i didnt like it, it cudnt power on.. excellent, everything was ok, the item is new in box and works like i thought. the item is like in the pictures. great case! has good texture so i don\\'t lose my grip. wonderful phone. it is super cheap so i was expecting a pretty bad device, but it\\'s really good. by far the best 4.3\" phone. excellent. highly recomendable everything i expected the real deal outter box clip only thing about this one is that the clip part does not rotate. awesome awesome product i used this phone exclusively for over a week but could not tolerate its shortcomings. i like the large, bright screen and how it feels in my hand. i also like that they don\\'t use software buttons. you get to use all of your screen, unlike some phones like the new moto-x pure. however, these positives were more than cancelled out by the following issues;1) wi-fi connectivity - barely connects to access points that my other phones access with ease. i\\'ve had to turn wi-fi off several times on the pure xl just to get online.2) battery life no where near what i expected. the first 2 cycles wouldn\\'t last all day. after a week it did get much better but still sub-par.3) voice recognition barely works (on occasion) and \"okay google\" not working at all even with google now launcher. plus, android won\\'t accept voice commands while the screen is off, like cortana can. i could have dealt with that by itself.4) although i like that they used capacitive buttons as opposed to software buttons, they are small and are not backlit. most times it took at least 2 tries to hit the outside buttons especially in limited lighting conditions.recently used phones: nokia lumia 1520 since it launched until about 6 weeks ago when i started using a samsung galaxy note 4 until i got the blu pure xl. i am back to the nokia lumia 1520 wit its incredible battery life, cortana and no junk ware. i purchased this new iphone 5c and went to sprint to activate it. i was told by sprint that this phone is a stolen one, and can not be activated!!!!! i like this phone good product was good overall but the person on the other end could not hear while on speaker... was definitely not a network issue. great protection and a good price. highly reccomend ordered phone . great shipping . would have been better if i could use it on my account like the description stated . all esa good equipo en buen estado de funcionamiento simplemente genial , gracias un cordial saludos desde venezuela excelente equipo ..... si lo es i really wanted to like this phone, b/c the specs, on paper, seemed good and the price seemed reasonable. i like to take a lot of pictures and videos w/ my phone, so naturally, i place a high priority on camera and video quality. i had high hopes for this phone given its 13mp camera, but obviously, the megapixel numbers don\\'t mean much in this case. while picture and video quality is adequate in good light, though the colors were rather dull, in low light the picture quality for both still and video was extremely poor. attempts to adjust the exposure by changing the settings did not help. also, the settings are unnecessarily complicated and don\\'t result in better pictures or videos. it seems what this camera needs is a better quality image sensor and smarter auto settings.. aside from that, there was an annoying problem which ultimately convinced me that i should return this phone. there was an inexplicable, intermittent glitch in the on/off function that wouldn\\'t go away; i don\\'t know for sure if this is mechanical or software issue, but what was happening was that every now and then, after shutting the power off, the power button became unresponsive as though the phone were dead. the only way i could get it to power on again was to first remove the battery and then put it back in. since i was intending to use this phone on a trip to europe this summer, i did not want to take the risk of this phone going totally dead during my travels. as such, i am returning this phone. other minor complaints would be that the speaker doesn\\'t sound good, and also the included earbuds sound really weak. as far as its other functions, everything worked well. on the t-mobile network i got good 4g lte connection and excellent date speed consistently, no dropped calls, decent voice quality both ways, and the gps navigation worked fine, too. all in all, if it weren\\'t for the above issues, this phone would be an acceptable product for the price, but if you are willing to settle for a low quality camera there are plenty of other comparable quality phones that cost less.update: i have since replaced this phone w/ the amazon fire phone which was on sale for under $200 w/ 1 yr of prime included, and am very happy w/ the decision. the camera on the fire phone has superb low light performance - it is better than most other camera phones out there, regardless of price. all ok all i can say about the iphone is i love love love my phone thanks apple i almost never put my iphone down it is glued to me my true love lol lol excellent so many features, so easy to use!! good this phone is extremely hard to read and not very user friendly. i had got this phone for my mom who had a motorola phone which is the same size, but this one has very small print and only options is to change it to smaller print. i have only ever owed samsung phones and love them, but this was such a disappointment. i gave it 1 star because it came right away.i also have never written a review, but i felt this should be know. she likes it. i bought this phone to use it in venezuela, it came locked to be used only with at&t \"not as advertised\" works great thanks nice job piece of crap. could have spent that money on a better phone. perfect thank you broke after a week not as heavy as original ! i know it is a silly idea but i want to use a cell phone to talk to people. i have speakers for music and gps and cameras i just want to hear people and have them hear me. what a concept. tried a pile of blue tooth set and nothing but complaints. must charge etc. i have plenty of wonderful wired headsets with boom mikes. that is what people who talk on phones use who want people to hear them. plug standard three conductor 2.5 mm plug into headset and i can hear peachy keen but it uses mike on the phone not the boom mike. try adaptors galore. none work. stumble over two accessories on nokia europe wh-200 and hdb-5. both over the ear with boom mike. i make the usual useless call to nokia. \"sorry sir that is not available to you.\" apparently americans just listen to music and play games on their phones. oh i tried a 3.5mm adapter on the e62 to a 2.5 mm headset and it did not work either. i tried a sony with their proprietary plug and it kept losing contact. i tried a motorola with the mini-usb and the phone answers by default when the plug is in and cannot be charged while on the phone. on to the blackberry...next..... awesome phone im so terribly disappointed this is my second blu life xl in less than 1 year 3 months that have overheated on me and have died.my last purchase was in may of this year 2016 and within the last few weeks phone started feeling very hot and now it will not take the charge and locks its self off. took it to be repaired and was told again that it makes no sense getting a battery or trying to fix cause the phone is no goodtotal waste of my money best phone ever no what i order t camera and design*update* still love the phone as much as i did.be sure to get a case it would be a shame to dent/scratch this beauty.the ppi is definitely noticeable.it\\'s only a 1080p screen but again the pixel density makes up for it.nfc technology is active if your into tech. i replaced my older razr v3m that i dropped on concrete with this exact duplicate. it\\'s a great little phone if you don\\'t want or need all the bells and whistled. and for the price, a very good deal. the was in almost perfect condition. no scratches on the screen or body. i was very impressed with the phone. i would definitely recommend this seller. the phone was in better shape than i expected since the price was so low. i\\'ve been using this phone for a week now. i also own the lumia 1520 and had been using it for over a year until i ruined it by installing the windows 10 technical preview so i went for the 640 xl. contrary to most reviews of these phones, i personally give the 1520 4 stars and the 640 xl dual sim 5 stars. on paper it looks like the 1520 is the superior phone but if you\\'re willing to drop a little sharpness in the screen resolution (and camera picture size) then the 640 xl is the definite easy winner because:1. everything is smoother, more responsive and stable on the 640 xl.2. battery life, i get more out of the 640 xl though it is a smaller battery it uses less power.3. the form factor is much better, no more square sharp corners and the weight of it is lighter, no more heavy bulkiness. i really like picking up the new phone and feeling it in my hand.4. looks - get the white cover (trust me)5. cost - you get much more value6. gorilla glass 3 - more impact resistant. i once shattered the 1520 screen (gorilla glass 2 and less plastic frame to protect the edges) dropping it just 3 feet. it was expensive to fix! i didn\\'t realize that this phone doesn\\'t have a zoom but of the reste everything it\\'s ok.. it\\'s working without problems. excellent working phone, no problems at all. perfect in every way :-) awesome as described.best phone for low price.i highly recommend this phone.and the cam quality is fabulous. good i like this because the price was rightfor the products,samsung is one of the top phones and i need a change to a bigger phone i bought 2 of these phones i love them. they are terrific much more than i expected excelente very good all 100 % recomendado this phone is fantastic for the price and the build quality was excellent. however sprint stated the phone cannot be activated since it is not in their database as an approved device for their \"bring your own phone\" program. according to sprint\\'s website only the moto g4 and moto g4 plus are eligible to be activated. in store the rep tried to activate the play and was unsuccessful. got this to replace my old 2g flip phone which will stop working when 2g is phased out where i am soon. did not need or want to carry around what\\'s basically a $300 computer with a 5 inch screen. nor do i want to pay for a data plan. this is wifi enabled so i can still get online if my tablet isn\\'t handy.had to download a t9 keyboard. i was used to that format and the screen is too small to use the qwerty without a stylus. texting at the same speed as my old flip.others have noted that it needs an extended (8mm) tip micro usb cable.the sim size is micro. that\\'s the middle size between nano and mini that are used in cell phones. i had to order an adapter. seems crazy that the poshmobile.com site lists the sim card size as \"regular\". rather subjective....not for surfing or gaming, but if you just want a phone that won\\'t sag your pants or require a purse, this is it. great phone works well, i really like it. what for a phone. amazing .just loving it. i suggest it to everyone purchased for my niece. she loves the iphone. very nice and good quality beautiful screen.awesome display.snappy performancethe only problem i have with this device is the battery life other wise very satisfied i love it best phone i ever owned and seen we have 3 of these phones and we needed a replacement. we couldnt get it at the verizon store. amazon had it, we got it in 3 days i called verizon with the sn# put the battery in and it worked. it works on our existing plan no extra fees. it\\'s not a smart phone but its good for calling and texting good qwerty kybd it fits in your pocket and it\\'s durable. i love my octane! i went swimming with my other one and was so glad to find this one because verizon does not carry it anymore. latest software build is intended for older phones making it sketchy on some aps like maps. excellent product. good seller. great phone. own both the edge and s7 and would recommend the regular s7 over the edge because of the annoying inputs you get just by holding the phone due to the screen wrapping on the edges. yet to get a case for the edge since i prefer no case but will have to try one as i heard it helps fix the accidental touches greatly. the s7 feels great and boasts impressive hardware and a 1440p screen. the battery is also decent at 3000 mah. definitely one of the best smart phones on the market and easily outshines the iphone i absolutely love this phone. glad i spent my money on this. i\\'ve had this phone for almost a year. i use it on the t-mobile network and the lte works great. the camera is great! the screen is only 4k if you are looking at pictures in the albums app and the default sony video player. the battery life is great as long as you don\\'t keep needless features on while not using them. the waterproofing is great, i\\'ve washed the phone in the shower several times and it has not failed. i think it is funny that other brands are just now water proofing their phones, sony is way ahead of the curve in that aspect. the power button integrated finger print scanner is a nice touch,so you don\\'t always have to enter an unlock code. overall the phone is great and i waited almost a year just to write a review because i really wanted to thoroughly use and test the phone. not good at all order completed and delivered as expected. product in new condition. all good. very good. running good excelente bluetooth kept disconnecting. i was not happy with the number of button clicks needed to do simple things, like review texts. returned and got a quick refund. i like i like i bought this phone last month and it works perfectly...like normal blackberry\\'s. i was skeptical about buying it online but it was great. the seller to choose is wireovia.. they are prompt and answers you as soon as you want to query. buying it from my seller you get a silicone case and a hard case :) i have had this phone for about a year now and in my honest opinion don\\'t buy it. there is a reason it is so cheap. you only get 4gb of storage for your own personal use and when you get an app, it says that you have no storage when you do. even with an sd card. also, the phone crashes all the time, it is laggy, and it is just an overall nuisance. i highly recommend that you don\\'t get this phone; it is a waste of you money. i purchased the gold 16 gb variation of the iphone 5s and it is so beautiful for a device. the gold color on the back is very light, more like a champagne color, but it\\'s a very unique and unseen color for any phone, which makes, whoever buys it, stand out and unique. it\\'s an iphone, so that only means that it\\'s synonymous with greatness! i love the new, fresh os that came preloaded on the device, and the hardware is excellent too, especially the newly-debuted fingerprint reader. this phone is just downright simplistic and user-friendly that even your nana or grandpa can use it. i have used android devices for some time. recently i noticed even the inexpensive phone aren\\'t so inexpensive any more. and the quality is hit or miss. 6 months later and you can have an unusable device. i finally took the plung on ole \\'blu\\' here. glad i did. with a screen size have again as large as my previous phone, very quick response, and a great speakers. what a deal. i will start purchasing for other family members as funds allow. what a great buy! i am very pleased of the phone that i received!! it came earlier than expected and looked like new!!! this is my second posh and my second smartphone. i upgraded because i wanted gps. my sister is going to take my old pegasus which is still functioning fine. i love my titan, definately a crisper display and camera, but most of all it is super fast. i have to get my data working on it though. i don\\'t think it is the phone, i think it is something with configuring and setting it up. had to do something special with the pegasus too to get it set up. chatting now with my carrier to see if they can help me. it is a very large screen, so i am going to gift my asus tablet to someone as i really don\\'t need it anymore. this phone is faster than my tablet. the item was in excellent condition i am very disapointed with this phone. i have owned several blu phones and loves all of them. this phone is the worst phone i\\'ve ever owned. i like the size only. the operating system is the worst. i don\\'t get 75-80% of my call. calls i do receive are poor quality, i can hardly understand what\\'s being said. it is not able to go to any sites, even sites i have previously visited. even in my home, on my wifi, it times out on searched several times, sometime finally will go to a site. most times i just give up trying and get on my laptop. i do not recommend the blu xl to anyone, and i will not purchase another on. i had great service with several blu studio 6.0. i am going to shelf this one and buy a studio 6.0. i have yet to receive this merchandise and their is no contact info. please help me amazon! i bought 3 ,one died after 2 weeks.unfortunately i couldnt get in touch with amazon😢😢😢😢😢😢😢. the figo phone it take\\'s too long to load and the screen freeze at times i\\'m thinking about sending it back....it is not worth the for money paid for honestly. thanks loved it i love it 😊 verizon indicates that the phone is not compatible with their system excellent product and seller worthy a-star, but the problem lies in the same machine moving and difficult transitions between menusand clarity of the screen and the camera is very bad because the screen broke, unfortunately, after installing the battery and this shows that the device must be dealt with ktaaof with a bomb that is to say a very sensitive device at any impelling unbreakable such as eggthis is my point of view the device in either the seller is excellent and dealing with a very sophisticated i visor it is a cheap phone, with limited functionality. probably good for a student, as it is strongest with photos, media, etc. i can\\'t keep it charged, almost daily needs juice, but works fine when charged. it ruans very slow basic cell phone with bluetooth. excellent value for the money. the volume will not work on the phone because the rubber on the case is too long and bends out of the way instead of pushing the phone buttons, everything else looks and works great! everything was as expected. perfect! this review will be less about the product itself (because we all know this is an amazing, powerful, fast, feature-packed flagship smartphone) and more about sim compatibility/network. because that\\'s why we\\'re looking at unlocked phones, right?i digress. in june, i bought the straight talk samsung galaxy siii from walmart for $459.99. i thought it an amazing purchase that i would not regret... i was so wrong. little did i know it was a cdma phone (locked to straight talk) and it ran on the sprint network. this meant little to me then, but it means the world to me now, because i now know that sprint is the most awful, bogged-down, spotty, insert-derogatory-phrase-here network on this entire planet. i live in hawaii, and sprint\\'s network in hawaii is an absolute joke. i had no service at my own house or my workplace that was right on the convergence line of two sprint towers (sprint can\\'t switch towers very easily so just went into roaming). the closest sprint tower to my house had a coverage radius of roughly 1 mile, and still does. and worst of all, it\\'s a 3g-only network. not a regular 3g network, either. i got edge speeds at best. i\\'ve never pulled more than 1mbps on the up or down. straight talk\\'s s3 was also very watered down, with a locked bootloader and very limited software accessibility. it was a sad life for me.i had had it. i was done with this pitiful excuse for a carrier. all my friends had either at&t or verizon, who both had full lte buildouts here. they always pulled webpages and videos like lightning. their coverage was broad and consistent. i figured it was time to pinch a few pennies. i had heard that straight talk had released an lte-capable at&t sim card, and i needed a phone for it to power. i had my heart pretty much set on the s4, but didn\\'t know which one to get.this was the one.the product arrived brand-new and completely unopened. shiny new s4. i put it in the wall, popped the sim in, edited the apn settings ([...]) and bam. the 4g lte icon popped up in the status bar, as well as two consistent bars of service. my experience thus far has been wonderful - i\\'ve been pulling a pretty steady 15up/19down everywhere i\\'ve been thus far. i now have coverage in my home. i have yet to see the no service icon. this may not be a problem for many of you as you may be already coming from at&t\\'s network - but it\\'s a whole different world for me.tl;dr? this phone works perfectly with straight talk\\'s at&t micro sim card. there is no hassle and no fuss - i set it up entirely online in 10 minutes. if these qualifications meet your criteria, buy this sucker - you won\\'t be disappointed. everything ok bought this as a present for my son - he\\'s quite happy with it and it works perfectly. so far so good. i brought this phone for a friend of mine mother ,after seeing it and how it works i ended up ordering two more a golden white for myself and a slate gray for a friend. the phone works great i have had no problems with it and the delivery was very very fast they said 3 to 5 days and i got it in about 24hrs.to the persons who handle my order great work keep it up, i will be ordering again soon. cool more than pleased with the i phone 5 unlocked met my requirements decent phone but the stylus is garbage, i pulled it out for the first time and it broke, leaving half of it in the phone. i really love this phone.excellent camera quality.only thing is that it uses a mini sim and not the micro ones so i\\'ll need to get a new one but great overall! also excellent customer service. it took a few days to arrive but good service. it\\'s not the best but it\\'s pretty good for the price watch is crap! can\\'t find al bt notification apps that will let me use half the the features. i have a verizon and not compatible to get a sims card with them. waste of money. super this phone is awesome for the price. it does everything the big box phones do. no issues with it excellent i had this htc evo 4g for 4 years when it did finely fall out of my hands onto the concrete and bought another one instead of upgrading because this android phone was a leader in new technologies and it still today stands the test of time... so i had to buy another one 4 years later... loved the phone. was well packed and received it on time without any delays. looking forward to use the phone i had bought 2 of these to replace the ancient phones my kids were using. after seeing them in action for a couple of months, i got myself one as well to replace my aged s2. (the multitude of available colors is great!) it may not be a massive powerhouse like the newest flagship phones from the big name brand companies, but at such a small fraction of their price it\\'s definitely nothing to scoff at and it performs excellent!the lack of lte may turn some people off, but it\\'s still plenty fast on regular 4g for me. (t-mo) my only real complaint is the small (8gb) built-in memory size, as it should really be at least 16gb+ these days with so many of the popular apps requiring installation on the internal storage rather than sd. memory is cheap these days so it really wouldn\\'t take much to increase this. i gladly would\\'ve dropped an extra $50 for a 16gb version of this phone. (and probably will if they end up creating higher-memory models!)overall, this phone is downright amazing for the price point. if you want a decent android phone for a great price and you\\'re not concerned about having \\'the next big thing\\' from the name brand companies, give this phone some serious consideration! phone works but internet doesn\\'t work and sd slot doesn\\'t work so how do you put anything onit music or video excelente producto. inntime all perfect superb, works very well for venezuela after i put the sim card in and then the battery i only get service until i move it or try to use it. then i have remove the battery and reinsert the sim. it has been a very big disapointmenht. i do like the idea of a watch phone though. i am in belize now where i received the watch now i can\\'t return it. speedy delivery and works great the description didn\\'t say the phone would all be in spanish! the box & instructions were all in spanish. took a whole lot if trial & error to change the setting to english. in love with my phone!!!! i bought it as an international client, and was a little bit scared, but it was the biggest online \"risk\" i ever took and was rewarded.........thank you for my great service samsung my friend loved it! yes it came very fast perfect condition everything my teenager daughter wanted thanks i love it slower than i thought. freezes at times. doesn\\'t work in europe gsm 900/1800mhz tmobile. it works but it came with missing internal components like screws and metal plates that secure wires. bought it for my friend. he likes it. i purchased it for a friend of mine in jamaica. i called him frantically all day trying to reach him . i couldn\\'t until 2 days later he called me to say the was dead and would not turn on. it eventually did. but still has a tendency to freeze. would not recommend. for $50. maybe. fast delivery ordered friday morning and recieved it monday afternoon. great phone for being used no problem with tmobile just a new sim card purchase. tiny knick on side of phone, a case can hide that. my son will be extremely happy with it :) just as good as my s4 going to my daughter that i purchased new. would purchase from again! when i received this phone, which it took about a month. i got the phone i was excited for how big it is, but after waiting so long to get the phone i couldn\\'t even use it without a sim card. finally got the sim and found out that the internet doesn\\'t work, which means the google play store doesn\\'t work, which means i cant do anything with this phone but call and text. this sucks because im into apps and the internet. am i the only one who had this problem????? this product is total garbage.. can\\'t go wrong with an iphone. this has been my favorite phone. when my old one started acting up, my grandson suggested i look online for one. i found this and it was delivered in perfect time, as my other one died. very happy to have a new phone. been using it for almsot 2 days and haven\\'t encountered any issues. it was kinda difficult to get my phone to connect because you have to install an app and some software but it\\'s sorted out with the booklet. it\\'s a great phone! muy bueno arrived as expected. great condition.....works great. good used device. 80% good. rare camera is not working. i showed it to i-phone tech (iphoneaid.com) in baltimore, md. john fixed it in 15 minutes. checked the i-phone and replaced the rare camera with new part. thanks to amazon and iphoneaid.com bought this phone for my 12 year old daughter. the phone arrived on time and was just as described. my only issue was that it is supposed to be a new phone, however, the charger was clearly used and did not work. otherwise the phone is great. i was looking for a phone that provided me with a good camera and good screen real estate at a reasonable price and this phone fit the bill. it works great except that it sometimes lags while recording videos and while attempting to run certain apps. other than that, its a great phone for a reasonable price. very good i bought this phone to replace one of the same model that got destroyed. popped in my sim card and everything worked just as it should. no problems with phone, material, or sender. very happy with purchase. excellent seller and products and very nice best phone i have ever owned great phone, better than my iphone 6 plus that i have from work! this samsung galaxy prime is a very nice phone works and looks great, nice great phone but signal reception / service for lte t-mobile nonexistent in rural area compared to my standard issue t-mobile phone at same location. perhaps modem chipset / antenna inferior? great item everything i expected at a much better price than its ios counterpart. i love the color of this phone...reminds me of a frog! lol....packaging was great, timing of delivery was great....i charged it fully when i got it, used it and then started to notice that the battery did not hold the charge and now that it is cold, will just shut off....i ordered a new battery and had it installed...works great even when it is cold out! product was in great condition with generic charger/usb. next phone will be a 6...which will probably be when they create an iphone 10....lol excellent device stay away from this phone. the camera does not work. it gives an error message: \"camera has stopped unexpectedly. an error report will be send to htc to help us improve our products.\" called htc customer service. they attempted to trouble-shoot but it still did not work. since it is an international phone, it has no warranty! awesome. muchos problemas al escribir excelente lasted only a few months and then gave up. who do i send it back to./ looked and works as i hoped for with a refurbished phone. seller answered all my questions and we got the phone quickly through mail. i am pleased and highly recommend this seller :) if u r looking for a brand new, don\\'t go for this. i ordered and received in time. but its not a brand new. its very refurb. seller didn\\'t mention here whether its brand new or refurb. tats not fair.. 2 stars for the product and for the sellers, i can say buyers beware.. the order came in time and was as described. it\\'s perfect ,the negative reviews are not true and i would definitely recommend buying from igm prime awesome phone! the delivery coming very fast. it lasted my 4 years, lol granted, this is an older model, but i prefer to hold at least the semblance of a phone next to my ear than a wanna be ipad (iphone 6 and others). the format was easy to learn: i also use mac computers. i like the touch screen. would prefer not to have the apple watch icon, which so far i fail to find how to remove.i don\\'t harbor hoards of pictures, but do use the phone for my kindle books (300+) and solfeggio music (lots again) and the 16gb seems to be adequate for my needs. basically, the phone is more for business than personal. it is my first experience with texting and have to admit, i have become a fan. quick. to the point. get \\'er done. important in our no nonsense little time work world.important to know: my account with at&t is a monthly no contract. when i asked about a contract, the sales rep told me because this is considered a \"third party\" phone, i was not eligible for a monthly contract. that requires buying your phone from an at&t distributor or directly from them. for me this was fine. i got a great deal with more data time than a contract arrangement and my monthly is less than $50.another point to ponder: no one really tells you that with this phone (maybe others?) every month it is best to completely shut it down to reboot. after all, it is a computer. i found this out when i lost capability to enter addresses into my contacts. a friend who had used the i5s alerted me to the reboot feature. doing this, i have not had any further problems, mechanically.con: that in a way all apple products are intrusive into our life by recording and keeping a digital record of everything you do on the phone: calls, texts, web sites. i understand android does the same, but not as intrusive as apple. i don\\'t like this aspect at all. be aware.product was delivered per my special request on time. product not exactly as described by seller and no instruction guide included. because of some other customer service issues, i find it difficult to recommend the third party seller. the phone is spotty when it comes to charging. i plug it in and it registers that the power is plugged in, but it doesn\\'t always charge. i have to check four to five times, unplugging and plugging it back to before i might get it to charge. i also had the speaker go out within three days of using it, but that fixed itself somehow and now works again. hi, i bought a new piece but there is some defect with the headphones. the audibility using that headphones is very bad. i can barely hear what others are saying and others can\\'t hear my response as well. i\\'m not satisfied with the functionality of the phone as well. i\\'m not happy with this piece. don\\'t even think of buying this one. phone looks new! works great! i sent it to my mother in india. she complains stating phone is becoming warm when she talks over the phone even for 5 minutes. i am not at all satisfied with the phone. it is purple/blue color. my 11yo has this and it works great. she has dropped her phone many times and no phone breakage.update: after 6 months of using this case. the rubber has started to peel. i have very serious doubt that this is a real otterbox. a real one wouldn\\'t start to peel. buyer beware. i will only order straight from otterbox now! fire everything is ok, except the battery !!!!!!!!!!!! it drains fully for 2 hours, is it ok for 4200 mah battery ???? the phone keep cuting off and one very thin and low battery usage. of course, it depends on the user how long the battery will last on a single charge but this one exceeds my previous phone. it is a great phone for the price - highly recommended. i am very happy with this purchase lenavos860 .battery life was amazing .first charge stays 7 days . but once i installed face book figure it out battery stays for 2 days .so i decided to remove face book app from my phone ,but it have skype & viber ,battery stays fir 7 days. china brand company delivery my phone in 10 days ..i recommend this phone to all very good thank you phone came locked that only previous itunes account holder can unlock. went to apple and verizon with no luck, was advised to return phone. the phone is great. hardware-wise everything works as it should, and the phone is touch, durable, and rugged. only problem is that at&t software is deeply embedded into the firmware, and so if you want to use it for t-mobile (as i do) or other gsm providers, be prepared to use it strictly for phone calls and texts (and photos, though the camera is anemic at best) . no gps, no internet, no email, not unless you have at&t service. i did find a hack online to make the internet browser to work, but it was a pain in the rear. unless you can find a custom rom for this thing (which i couldn\\'t), you\\'re stuck with mostly a cell phone (which might be ok for many of you). as far as t-mobile calls go, the phone was in fact \"unlocked\" and all i needed to do is pop in my simcard. battery life is quite good also. for what it is, it does a good job. the app is a little hinky to get started but, after that, performs as expected. case is great, provides great protection and phone is still easy to use and it has the wichita state shocker colors to boot! go shocks! good thank you it is different from my old android phone!!! some things are good changes, a few things i miss!! but i love it and am still learning new things!!! excellent watch at that price! perfectly fits my wrist, good design.connect to iphone 6s smoothly to sync calls, very surprised for the clear sound quality. need more time to check more functions.spend a little more time to connect to samsung galaxy, this watch has much more functions for android os phones but needs to download their apk file and install, it costs more time but made me surprised it can control my samsung galaxy\\'s camera.not tested each function but this watch is really great at that price. 5 star! worst cell phone i have seen!! worst. it is failed that i bought it. it is worth $10 rather than $40. bought as gift battery is easy to become hot i used blackberry phones for many years and for the the last few years i had several iphones and i recently owned a galaxy.pros:small, has many preinstalled applications, such as office, maps, twitter,youtube, maps and the media support is also very good. can stream audio via bluetooth.cons:this phone has good features when compared to the iphone/galaxy however the touch feature is terrible in comparison. sometimes it responds, sometimes it does not. there are hardly any applications in the store that are useful and installing/uninstalling applications require a full system reboot which is terrible. furthermore, there is no way to completely turn off this phone, therefore if are having issues you will have to remove the battery. i will definitely not recommend this phone to anyone. i love it. just wish there was instructions. i am not a techie. this phone along with my previous phone purchases on here were horrible. big waste of money. samsung galaxy s7 edge factory unlocked phone 32 gb - international version g935f- black oynxabsolutely disappointing, the charging port was hurt at 4 days, and today after 10 days has begun to smoke and smell of burning. i\\'ll have to repair the \"new\" cell. i\\'m angry and i\\'ll never buy in this shop. the screen was popped out. it had scratches on the back. didn\\'t match description. i dropped it on a soft surface and my screen was jacked. i had to pay to get it fixed. phone was exactly as expected. the earpods didn\\'t work, but the seller replaced them promptly after i contacted them! i would have given 5 stars but... if you want to use the dual sim cards, the second card must be a nano (no big deal, any carrier will cut it down for you) but if you want to use dual sims and have external storage micro sd card, you can\\'t. it is designed to be one or the other.... it\\'s dual sims or 1 sim and 1 external storage micro sd card. to me that should have been explained .... i\\'ve called the spoke with blu consumer dept and that is exactly what they told me. other than that, it\\'s a great phone for the price. perfect phone for the price i read a lot of reviews about this phone before i purchased it. it was a lot of good reviews and it was some bad reviews the good reviews out did the bad so i bought it and it was very very mind blowing this phone is of the chain its way better than galaxy s3. this phone has good picture quality sound quality camera quality feature quality so if u wanna buy this phone don\\'t think long on it buy it i glad i did it didn\\'t even cost that much and its a better phone than some of these or should i say a lot of these name brand phones and battery life excellent ! do not waste your money! as described, super fast shipping! phone works perfectly! as a person that recently got into the world of smart watches, i had to learn a lot in a short time.i\\'m writing this review while holding an iphone because i haven\\'t seen anyone do it. it does everything as described on the description, you can control your music (it basically works as a bluetooth speaker), answer phone calls, set an alarm, track your steps, and make calls. the only things that you can\\'t do on an iphone is get text, mail, and social media notifications, but if you have an android you should be fine. overall the smart watch did perform to what i had expected which was good in my book. good phone recently in use yet, very very recomend for all world than require a smart phone for work !!! good great phone put in at&t sim and it was go to go.works very well.love it well worth the money.24 month warranty also. was a good choice very good the phone does not work with verizon... which is not specified the balance of cost and benefits is perfect, it\\'s beautiful and light.. good phone . gsm isn\\'t unlocked as stated excellent love it! works perfect! would recommend buying from this buyer again awesome phone defective upon arrive. was not on locked like the description says ended up having to buy an unlock code online to attempt to put on my straight talk account, but the phone will not read any sim cards. unfortunately returning the phone and back to shopping elsewhere i shan\\'t go into all the features, other reviews have them covered.you heard about the tracking hack that google pulled? since this needs google, you should carefully consider how much you value your privacy before you buy.ok. let me set the context. albert einstein was still alive and kicking when i was born. i do not have the best eye sight, hand-eye coordination is ok, as is hearing, hands a bit on the larger side and not as steady as they were 20 years ago.use mostly for data, have had the phone for 2 months and not used 100 voice minutes total.the goodnice screen. i was concerned that i\\'d have trouble typing but in landscape mode, which you just shake to get to, the keys are big enough. the gps feature works well for me and i\\'ve so far had great coverage and no lost calls. the menu is fairly intuitive, and with a bit of exploration is ok.the badthey load it up with lots of rubbish apps. t-mobile market place and voice messaging are two (there was another i don\\'t recall). all useless and i\\'ve been bothered having to update them both for no purpose. when i say useless, the market had nothing of interest to me in it and the voice thing wouldn\\'t launch.th battery life is about a day. ths thing sucks power like an abrams m1 sucks jp8. a bit longer with all power saving on, but not much.the screen goes dark 2 - 5 seconds after you dial. thats a real problem if you call a answering system. hard to \"press 3 for customer service\" if there is no visible 3 on the screen. this is a real bad bug. i am constantly having to push a button to \"wake up\" the screen. of course, doing that puts me back to the main screen and i may or may not have lost the call. so, in terms of useability, this goes dim/goes dark bug (which you can not prevent from happening - i called about it) means i can not recommend this phone.i turned off auto sync (to save battery) and to my chagrin learned that unless its on, your g-mail inbox doesn\\'t check for new mail. nowhere did i see that warning, nor did it ask me \"do you want to check for new e-mail now?\". reminds me of software from 1998!!!there is this blank screen (screen saver?) that covers the icons after a couple of seconds too. so once the screen goes dark, pushing the on button doesn\\'t even return you to where you were before it decided 3 seconds is long enough for you to be inactive.the swiping needs work too. sometimes response is slow; as in you push a button or swipe (to scroll) and nothing happens for several seconds. if you don\\'t wait (and forget about aubible feedback!) you can scroll right past where you want to go.the screen edges are less sensitive and i often have to repeatedly swipe or press to get any response. while in other cases i swipe but the phone interprets it as me clicking on a icon and up pops some app or another. not cool. its almost like they haven\\'t learned anything about user interfacing from the macs and pc business.two other things and i\\'m done.the off button is on the opposite edge from the sound volume rocker. this extremely poor design means if you hold it in one hand and push/squeeze it off chances are you also changed the ring volume. really poor design.finally, i\\'ve tried four 3.5 mm headphone sets (wired) and none work with this. there are no impedance specifications listed, nor was customer service able to help. its ridiculous. so either i need to get a more modern pair of ear phones or the unit is defective. but come on! no impedance data for the headphone jack?!?!btw best work-around for the screen going dark when you need access to the keypad is to set the phone on \"speaker\" phone. the samsung forum is much more useful than technical service = non responsive.to sum up: i don\\'t have any other smart phone to compare this with but i hear power is a problem on many of them. the gui (user interface) is slick but crippled: i have no doubt that in a couple of years the phones will work like you excpect a phone to work, without roadblocks and frustrations. i blame the newness of the technology rather than samsung &/or android. i am itching to try an iphone though...its hard to believe they are all this bad...who knows. i got this phone because i travel often and am looking forward to using it. so far it has been functional with t-mobile network.i had to purchase the phone twice because the first one i got did not turn on. the battery would say it\\'s charging but never charge and the power button did not work. so i sent that one back and got the exact same phone.the second one i have turns on and everything works except the volume control buttons on the side. however, seeing as i am travelling soon i will probably not get it replaced.i am assuming the problem is with the dealership not with the phone themselves. they need to do a quality check to make sure the phone is functional before they ship it out. i just bought this phone not long ago and its already quit on me im really upset .. don\\'t know what to do it\\'s small enough to carry always, with enough screen size. it support dual sim with different sizes. wanted this for travel and liked the dual sim capability. very lightweight and flimsy phone. worked ok while it worked, but not it is completely dead after 6 months of very little usage. no warranty info in user guide and only contact number is in nigeria. i don\\'t think it is really an lg phone. it met my expectations. i am using it overseas and it works pertectally one of the best sony smartphone i have used , awesome built quality . the best quality used phone! it would have to spit out $20 bills to rate it a 5 star. it\\'s faster than my motorola a855 and doesn\\'t freeze up therefore i don\\'t have to reboot it constantly. very little i don\\'t like. i can\\'t blame my fat thumbs for hitting something which activates something else, they don\\'t sell thumb guards. for the time i\\'ve had it, i sure hope it stays in this condition for at least a couple years. we\\'ll see. the letters on the keyboard are missing during typing, after only 4 weeks. i would expect an exchange from the seller. otherwise great phone. but this issue makes the phone practically useless. this happened one month into use. i believe this should be covered in a one year warranty. please advise asap. thanks. great deal on this phone. i took a big chance and had a lot of doubt. the phone arrived on excellent condition and for the price this was a great deal. thank you\\' good service and totally new deviceperfect thank you no problems activating. so far, so good. not so bad nice i like it a lot, been using it for a while (about 9 months), it\\'s starting to feel slow (android os) but i guess is normal for the use. i don\\'t give it five stars because i do have an issue with the screen, suddenly a dark shadow appeared and lasted about 2 months then it disappeared and suddenly it came back a few days ago, if i\\'d live in the us i\\'d request warranty replacement. it works fine with the venezuelan line services. great phone i love it !!! it\\'s great 100% recommended excelent phone everything works fine excellent phone, all perfect, so much better than the famous and popular smartphones s4 s5 htc one iphone5 etc polaroid should stick to cameras. 100% reconmedable .saludos it\\'s a basic phone. have not whatsapp and the cam is very simple, but i boght it because i needed an alternative phone and this is a good option. bought this as a gift for my daughter, mainly because it was advertised as \"certified\" refurbished and the price seemed right. the phone arrived when it said it would, but it will not hold a charge and shuts down unexpectedly minutes after a full charge. i left chasing what apple says is likely a software issue, or purchasing a new phone. extremely disappointed. glitches alot delivered at the right time.great phone. only issues i have is with the adaptive brightness and fingerprint scanner very cheap material and phone doesn\\'t work after two months. problem with a sound quality and display. very bad , poor quality, wifi disconnects every few minutes , warmed when loading is very slow. i did not like anything,i would not return because i am in mexico love it! good i like this phone, good price. all it\\'s excellent! they told me the cellphone was new but judging by the appearance, it wasn\\'t.then i don\\'t get my messages complete, specially when somebody text me from smart phones good value for a starter phone. screen and responsiveness are surprisingly good love the s5 just wish i could have gotten one that was a t-mobile carrier phone. i have made do, but when you have spotty service it makes it very hard to make calls or send texts. can\\'t use wifi calling on t-mobile network. i am satisfied. .. this is the worst thing ever happen to me i bought this watch phone the phone does not working and when i tried to return the item they stop me from doing it the description says it is an unlocked cell phone, but as soon as you try to use any sim card that is not from t-mobile, cell phone shows a message \"network locked\", \"please contact customer care\". i tryied to reach worldwide distributors twice, but until now, i got no answer. perfet delivery was correct, but the version of software is not the newest and neither have the option to update; my boyfriend has the same model of another supplier and seems more advanced; i do not understand why. i really like this phone, be reeeeeally sure you want a reaaally big phone before purchase because it is huge! better than i expected. the price is right. totally a great phone. this is my first experience with htc phone and its really make me happy. this phone has everything that any ideal phone should have. the best feature is 3d. the 3d experience is really far beyond my expectation!!. excelente producto so far is good everything is so great except the battery life. it\\'s terrible and can\\'t last for a full day.if battery life is important to you, don\\'t consider this phone first of all i want to say i have been an apple user since the iphone 4s came out. big apple fan. until i decided to switch it up and never sign a 2 year phone service contract again. looking for a unlocked international phone in case i move out of the country, i found this. at a couple hundred dollars (cheaper than a 16gb apple 4s) i found this phone to be affordable and impressive for the price on paper. upon receiving the device and setting it up i was impressed at the quality and sheer screen size of the thing. it has a clear and crisp screen, lots of ram, great camera, large battery and is very user friendly. this is my personal opinion and i am by no means a phone snob. i previously replaced an iphone 5 16gb with the zenphone 6 and do not regret it whatsoever except for the fact tthat the iphone was in no way needing replaced. now i have this and absolutely love it. it is awesome and i would recommend the phone to family and friends all day. a very nice and fast device, i have no problem viewing all my documents. excellent price. fast shipping. i recommend it. works like described. good reception, camera and battery life. thin size and big screen make for good viewing. excellent sound as well. i have read a lot of articles about the note 3 and kind of knew what it should like. i think this is a keeper and will enjoy it for a long time. like i said a great phone. i was very dissapointed in this phone. i bought a used phone that was supposed to be in very good condition. it was not. when i got it the battery was no good and i had to purchase another. some of the buttons are worn so bad that you can\\'t read them and when you open the phone to use the qwerty the screen cannot be seen unless the phone is only half open. i will never buy from this seller again. cutting edge phone comparable to iphone6s in a smaller package. my daughter loves it. great phone! i have to take the battery out to work cause it sticks im going to return it not happy with it only thing good was it was delivered on time good. was all i expected and more the sony experia, is what i xpected and is intended for use oversea and the person is happy with it wow this is a very thin phone. it is very fast and has a nice screen. the camera on front and back are nice. the battery lasts a long time with heavy use. it lasts me all day with heavy use. bluetooth and wifi works. great phone. the price is really low too. if you have any questions ask i probably did not cover everything. i messed up my new blackberry and refused to pay the full price to get another. my daughter insisted i have a replacement, since i love blackberry phones. this phone works great. only thing i have not figured out is how to get the wifi to boost my signal inside my home. i like it when a product such as the lg lx260 rumor for sprint works so well. my teenager loved it. the fuctions worked well. i wish i new what type of memory card goes with it. we love taking pictures and that\\'s a great way to save memories. we would be able to in-put them to any computer. it will come handy when my parents want to see the pictures and they don\\'t know how to send them. over all very satified with the phone.thanks,wendy i hate the camera on this thing. the frontface defaults to \"beautification mode\" everytime you turn it on. if you dont want digital makeup in your selfie you need to turn it off every time. buttons are ill-placed for convenient use of camera. the camera is slow as hell, the phone in general is kinda slow too. the speakers are crap, cant hear anything unless you overdrive the global eq (nice feature!) to hell and back so everything sounds like crap anyway. really hate myself for buying this i shoulda just got a samsung galaxy. this phone is super liqhtweight to the point it just feels flimsy. eventually bricked out after a year or so.. buy good deal for price love it bueno this phone is awsome i have no complains.i have had it for 4 weeks now..so far so good. i love this phone. i had looked at the moto x 2014, nexus 6, samsung note, moto g. this phone is the best of both worlds, its a good value at $300 v. $500 or $600 for most other high end phones, while including many of the same features as the compeition. the battery life is far better then my nexus 4. even with moderate use the battery lasts me the whole day ! i don\\'t recommend to buy smartphones specially samsung without guarantee. in ecuador i can\\'t use this phone because there wasn\\'t the information about the countrie which samsung made it . i lost my money box was opened only to unlock the phone but phone was new and i love it i like that its big its like a small tablet it\\'s a good phone but it\\'s not at&t wtf! i specifically ordered this droid and instead got the droid x delivered. my question is why? i got a better camera from the phone that was delivered but is an outdated model. now i\\'m stuck with this crap great product. my mother, like many elderly people, wanted \"just a phone.\" she does not text or email or go online or do anything except talk on a phone, and a landline did not suit her needs. she also goes through cell phones like mad because she keeps getting them wet with \"just a teenie, tiny bit of water.\" so i was real glad to find a cheap phone on amazon, especially seeing as t-mobile had exactly 1 phone that was \"just a phone\" and for twice the price of this one. so i took a gamble and ordered this one for her.apparently it\\'s really easy to use. so easy that mom, who could never program her vcr, has figured out how to take pictures of her cat with it. she\\'s quite hard-of-hearing and has had no trouble hearing the phone ring, and i don\\'t have to yell at her when i call her. she was thrilled that her contacts that were saved onto her old sim card transferred to this phone just fine when i installed the card and booted it up. she especially loves just having to flip the phone open to answer, and snap it closed to hang up.it\\'s only been about a week, but so far, this phone is a huge win, both for her ease of use and for my budget. another great phone from htc. i\\'m a fun of their phones. never have been disappointed. my previous htc one x is being with me for almost 5 years and still working great. 3rd posh phone. overall excellent performance. data connection is only 3g despite its claims and display of 4g. battery life is not the best but will get you through the day for heavy users. this phone is an excellent choice, price for performance. compre el teléfono bb 8520, decía que era nuevo, la pantalla no funcionaba, lleve al servicio técnico y me indicaron que era usado everything ok, great product, great value i have been using smart phones since the palm treo 600, so i am not new to this. this is the nicest phone i have ever owned. i purchased the red one and everyone just stops and stares at it and windows 8 is great is is the best phone software available. really great phone for the price! nice the time constantly changes for no apparent reason, this was a \"refurbished\" evidently that doesn\\'t mean the same thing to me...you\\'d think they\\'d have corrected some of the issues, not frustrating that you can\\'t charge the phone unless you power it off....never have i seen this before. steer clear of the blu line-up, i\\'m back in the market for a moto-x or a samsung..these blu are thrash fyi i had problems with the phone because it came locked when the product you sold me was saying unlocked, having to pay to use it, it will lift me 3g at times chinese or one of those languages continually pop on screen and also there is at time background static and i cant hear or be heard by person with whom i am communicating with and the phone sticks as well on the plus side i like the features offered and can readily access them awesome phone :) great for protection and easy use. what\\'s not to like? great product, as always from apple.k. kris loomis is the author of how to sneak more yoga into your life and the modern shorts for busy people series. everything works great updating took really long but it\\'s on older phone still runs pretty fast processor wise every thing works ok except the second sim card it just won\\'t recognize it. but i\\'ll keep trying.thanks! este equipo es increíble no pensé que sería hermoso buena cpu y gpu un rendimiento excelente móvil item received in the expected conditions. love my new phone this is not a good mobile phone, i\\'m 6/18/13 buy mobile phone, is now the only 8/12/13. yesterday in the video process is suddenly interrupted, the screen is only a faint glow. but it can not be used, this is my second time to buy the mobile phone in the amazon. the first to buy a mobile phone is in the 6/10/13 date, i gave it to my brother. is a very bad.their mobile phone are rubbish? i have checked the chance of no return. return in 30 days, now only use no more than 3 months, the two mobile phone have been unable to use, i also have sought to write position, but did not find, i really do not know how to ask for help, they are also my disappointment.amazon co should let the factory have quality assurance, this is no reputable manufacturers, use only could no longer use no more than three months, can not boot love it.it\\'s a great sizeui is fastbattery life is excellent (usually use 30-50%/day)screen is very good, don\\'t let the releativly low resolution be a deterent, it\\'s quite good even looking at very small detail.the built-in sony apps can be somewhat annoying and not all can be uninstalled, but just hide them in a folder and turn off notification and they dont bother you.my only concerns are more with andriod than anything sony did. the privacy controls are insuffient, too much reliancy on google and it\\'s qutie a hassle to disable cloud based data sharing. (on the positive side you don\\'t need any relationship with sony to use everything, a sony account and cloud services can be skipped on startup and settings).as others have noted, this is the us sku. that means it\\'s missing 2 features: 1 no fingerprint reader, and 2 no smart battery control. most people know about the first one, but the lack of smart battery control is hidden in the manual. this means no \"learning your habits\" and charging a less than a max speed. because of this i don\\'t plugin my phone overnight because i don\\'t want it to charge to 100% or do so at a rapid speed, both of which lessen your battery life in the long term. yes it did meet my espectation . i love it. ok i ordered two phone from here so far the first was the lg voyager the second one is the lg ally i love that phone to death the main thing i like about the phone is that u have wi-fi and u can download app the camera is super good i like the flash and the sound everything is working good and the seller said the phone was used umm i think not it works like it never been touched at all but since im busy pros:wi-fi touch screen great user friendlycons:gets slow a little but it works good if u got 8gb chip not so well wit a 2gb on but other than that this a great phone :p i\\'m no techie or heavy user, so this has worked well for my needs. sd card reader has gone out, so i\\'m not as happy as i\\'d like to be. manufacturer says to do a factory reset to try to restore functionality before shipping it back while under warranty. i\\'ll have to find some time to be willing to lose everything and try that before the warranty is up. love it. i love this phone! i have had it for 3 months now. the battery life is awesome: i sometimes go for 2 or 3 days between charges (but then i am not using it to play music or video.) the cameras work great, i love being able to \"tab\" between apps, rather than having to close one and open another like on all my previous phones. the price is also excellent. my husband plans to get one of these soon, too. i would definitely recommend this phone is okay excellent! i like it some what but it comes with very little operating instructions so some things are hard to figure out. you have to down load the 108 page instruction manual.recently i have found that the battery life doesn\\'t hold for even 24 hrs not happy about that at allcan\\'t get the sound of receiving texts changed shows one sound does anotheri would look around before totally deciding on this one first.its not bad depends what you want to do with it. the blackberry itself works fine, but none of the applications i.e. facebook, twitter, and myspace, do not work on the phone. i realized that its not the apps, but the phone that has the issue. since there\\'s no refunds from this buyer i\\'m out of luck. had speaker problems with this phone from day one! occasionally, the phone rings, but missed many important calls.function key was also problematic; tried to contact amazon and originator about return/exchange. but got no reply; not at all pleased i decided to buy a reconditioned motorola razor but wish i hadn\\'t:the phone came with a weak battery and when i replaced it with a good one it goes through it real fast and takes a long time to charge back up.when it\\'s flipped open it looks like it booting up and it goes to 3 different screens before settling on one.i can\\'t open text messages that contain photos. and after 2 weeks of use the hinge became weak which causes the phone to short out and drop the calls.i\\'m no expert but i\\'ve had 3 razors (new ones), but this is a dud.--cheers please not: this phone is not factory unlocked, at&t unlocked. \"pink tree cammo\" wouldn\\'t normally be my first choice in color, but an otterbox for $8.87? i\\'m fine with it. it actually matches a camp chair i have!i got this for my iphone se and it fits perfectly. you can\\'t use the \"thumb id\" feature because there is a rubber \"plug\" over the \"thumb button,\" (which i think is there to \"protect\" the button from \"overuse issues\" -- i\\'ve encountered overuse of that button on an ipad so i assume there could be problems with the phones, too) but i\\'d rather have the button hold up than the thumb id, so that\\'s not a problem. never had a problem with this iphone. worked great. bought two. one works fine but other fails to find network properly. it worked perfectlyfor me! very good product, and good seller on my previous nokia flip phone, i was used to seeing the battery gradually discharge and i knew when it was time to recharge. with this one.....battery symbol just goes red. when i took off the back of the phone to remove the battery so that i could install my sim card, it was a real chore to get the back to \"click\" in. other than that, a nice, little cellphone for the price. also, it was a \"revelation\" to me that my sim did not contain my contacts. seems contact get saved to the phone, not the sim card. i fired up my old phone (no sim card needed) and was able to see all my contacts. it has very small screen,video quality isnt good.you can buy better phone with different brand in same price range.i never recomend this phone to anyone good this phone dis not meet my expectations. i know that when u buy something used, you will have some minor problems. but with this phone, there are quite a few major problems. truly i am not satisfied but i do not know the correct way to use my 30 day warranty. if someone can please contact me, it will be greatly appreciated! excellent phone and great price. thank you!!!! excellent! best phone ever!!! took awhile to get here but still arrived within the designated time frame. phone looks great and even came w a separate car charger and plastic case. however, the phone did not come with a battery and i\\'m having trouble getting in touch w maxtell wireless to rectify the situation. so i haven\\'t actually been able to use the phone yet. excelent phone does not come with the usb-adapter as other reviewers have mentioned. comes in a plain box with the power cord and fast charger. the phone is flawless on the outside. the back of the phone says \"refurbished by asurion\" etched into the metal, underneath the imei number. excelente i didn\\'t like it good..thanks nice phone camera quality is perfect tho is slow some times other than that i have no complains i love it!! what can i say about otterbox that they don\\'t say about themselves? this is my second obox. a couple weeks ago i get in the labo, pissed fron a tough day on the market and smash the living crap outta my cellie. needless to say, my phone lived to dial another day. my obox? not so llucky. this is my first defender and hopefully my last obox for awhile. i\\'m back to making millions. or at least my phone looks like a million bucks. excellent phone. after a few months, my daughter dropped her 5c and it broke. she said it was less than a foot, but then, this is the plastic case version...anyway, i\\'m writing to say how pleased i am with nu2u, bc i took the phone to apple store, and after a 15-minute \"component verification\" the phone passed. truly their lable of \"brand new, in the box, full apple warranty\" was true.thanks nu2u! i\\'m loving my new phone. i received it 3 business days after placing my order. an instructional step by step sheet was included which made set up with straight talk an absolute breeze!!! as instructed, a $6.99 one time net work fee was charged by straight talk. no problem. it took maybe 30 minutes for the straighttalk rep to talk me through simply because i speak \"redneck\" so i had to understand him. my phone came in it\\'s own box and everything is fine. the phone does everything i need it to do and yes, i recommend it and would definitely buy it again. thanks!! this product is interesting and good product. good factory. this product help for complete anything. is important have this product looks like new, the price is okay, a good bf purchase the product is almost new. it doesn\\'t have any issue. i love it. excellent bought this for my daughter and she loves it. she had the iphone 4 with a cracked screen and wanted to upgrade but on her new at&t no contract plan, they wouldn\\'t give her the upgrade so we shopped around an dfound the best price here through a 3rd party seller. arrived super fast in bew condition. the phone is very beautiful and works beautifully as well. it is a dual sim phone, but when you really put two sim card (one micro sim and one nano sim) using the tiny, space limited side drawer, you cannot put a micro-sd card because they design to share the micro-sd card slot with the nano sim card slot.for me, i really need to put 2 sim, one for company, another for personal. so, putting 2 sim and cannot get memory expansion for video & photo, and this short comes is not mentioned in the product description. if i know it before, i would buy blu studio one 4g. i only give it 3 star. i love this phone since i have had one for at least 4 years but the one i received was defective and sent it back very great. i recommend it to anyone. indestructible great, so far so good excelente producto, es nuevo de paquete, vino con todos sus accesorios, cargador, audifonos, estuche. la bateria llego dañada. por lo demas el telefono funciona muy bien con todas sus aplicaciones. levanta 3g con digitel ya que vino desbloqueado con las bandas 3g 1,4,8. works great not unlocked very bad manufacturing, no signal most of time!!! excellent cell phone it operates fine for normal use. but i used it for work to type report logs on and it was not working efficiently excelente glitches in software, i guess. screen will sometimes jitter around. screen not registering touches. the entire 7 row of keys unresponsive. all of this didn\\'t start to happen until had it for couple of months, so can\\'t return it. i took a chance on this phone and unfortunately i lost on this one. fortunately only out $140 rather than a much larger amount. i bought 2 black berry 8520 and received one of them broken. so, since there is no warranty for being an international version, i have the most expensive black berry 8520 ever known. no one is responsible. i am ussually not very gentle with my cel phones.i do not plan to use it under water but i often use it with wet hands, under the rain or swetingtherefore, i ruin several cel phones.the option of an active cel phone has allowed me to have a good (expensive) phone that will last me. dont buy it!!!i bought 2 and had problems with both of them.battery of both lasts only 4 hours. and in one of them i cant use 2g, 3g nor 4g when its supposed to work.(im frrm argentina). it\\'s an excellent seller i recomend a 100% i have had this phone for almost 2 weeks. i really like it except it has poor battery life. also whenever i am playing a game the back of the phone where the battery is gets real hot. other then the battery issue i am very pleased with it. my local att store was impressed on how fast it accepted the sim card ( i had a micro sim in my old phone which does not fit in this one). picture quality is great. sound is great. i\\'m truly enjoying all the features this phone offers. it disconnects with no warning and no reason. the phone can right beside of the watch and it will still disconnect it\\'s nice and fun mine arrived with dead headphone jack port. had to return to amazon for a refund. it nice good phone hi love it. works well no problems with this phone and i like all the features. recommended to some of my friends who have samsung. im sorry but the item i recieved was not the exact model. instead it is \"xperia x compact\". nice phone and decent for the price, but service areas limited and this is not due to the provider came without the pen, other than that was ok it works good for me but where can i get a new charging cable? i bought this for my little sister and she absolutely loves it! at first i was skeptical at how cheap the phone is. she been using the phone for a week now and so far no problem at all. the quality is pretty high for a cheap phone like this. the order arrived earlier than i expected it to be. overall, this phone worth every single penny. i purchased this tiny phone to use for fitness apps (mapmywalk & fitbit), kindle reader app, audible, & overdrive, as well as using like an mp3 player. i use this device offline & over wi-fi only & do not have it set up for wireless phone service. worked well with dolphin browser for vimeo videos also. bluetoothed with tomtom fitness watch & omron blood pressure monitor, but could not get it to work with the fitbit zip (fitbit app, but it will use the fitbit app to log a workout without a device).i have taken a few pics with the device. picture quality is okay & does also record videos. it has a slot for additional memory, but i have not installed any in mine. if you plan on using for much storage, i recommend adding memory (think it\\'s a microsd slot, but check the specs).pros: love the size, pocket-size. works great with audible audiobooks & overdrive audiobooks (from public library). large speaker on backside great for audiobooks & music (must use with speaker face-up though). it was very easy to usb device to pc & copy music over. has headphone jack. comes with earbuds, usb charger, & usb cable.cons: need to use stylus for detailed clicking, not recommended for browsing. getting the tip of charge cable in the right position is sometimes quirky. bought this for my son, he loves it. good phone she loves the phone but it has a bad charger and i have yet to hear back from them and i\\'m not happy about it. this is the second boulder i\\'ve owned, and this does not live up to the previous one from verizon.while this phone is rugged, the battery lasts for less than a day. i will try a new battery but it would have been nice if the one included had a little life.also, there is a lot of lag. i wait a long time when selecting menu items or composing messages.finally the speakerphone is barely audible unless you are in a silent room.all-in-all, i\\'m disappointed with this phone. it does not even come close to its predecessor. este telefono esta por encima de lo basico pero pero claro le faltan muchas funciones como 3g. sin embargo es un excelente telefono. se le puede descargar muchas aplicaciones de la blackberry store. el trackball responde muy bien. lo que si no me ha gustado es que no hace zoom a las imagenes. would not activate on metro pcs nice arrived in condition as advertised. i did not have any problems with upgrade. works and looks great. it\\'s great! i like it so much. it works really well and i feel that the price is reasonable too! this blackberry is the most perfect gift for my brother for this 50th birthday. it is a tad expensive but he \"loves\" owning one, so it is worth the money. for a couple of months, he was totally consumed with it, but he has come back down to earth now :) it is a classy \"toy\". i may get one for myself. i have been using the phone for around three weeks with no complaint so far. exactly as described, functioned with sprint as advertised, nothing hidden good celphone. i should buy one with high store capacity the phone was lock could not be used returned it i purchased the phone about a month ago and to date have no regrets...strongly recommend it! its value for money! well, i have only had the phone less than a month so it is hard to rate it other than that it arrived intact and as advertised and is currently working well and up to expectations, but again it has only been one month on this refurbished samsung s5. so, ask me more about it in 3 to 6 months,but so far i am pleased with this well refurbished s5. it looks nice as other phones, but the camera and the speaker have problems. when i talk on the ohone, i can hear the other side, but they can\\'t hear anyhting from me. and the camera gets frozen all the time and then automatically shut down. i have no idea how to fix them. sucks. paid a premium for what i thought was an organization that paid attention to their refurbishing. plugged it in. did not charge. i really like the graphics, the case sucks (lol), and the charging time of the battery drains really fast. other than those few thigns so far ilove the phone for the price. i purchased a galaxy prime duos and it didn\\'t work well for me. i just want to know where i can order an extra battery. i love love those phones i love this phone very fast shipping, and the phones are justo what i need. i thought inline staffs were fake b@ amazon with best mobile proved me wrong..cell works perfectly and ..gud job. can never have anything bad to say about apple. always reliable and does what i need it\\'s great... phone arrived on time and as promised. i am completely satisfied and would purchase again. thr amazing! not an original product. its a knock off. i got another phone just like this one at verizon store and realized the difference right away. it feels different this phone bends and cracks much more, and has minor visual differences. the biggest give away is that i noticed that there was a gap at the top of the phone and i could easily slide mi finger nail inside and lift up the screen.... this phone is everything i need. the quality of the picture is perfect i love it and everything there is about the phone great smartphone. blackberry os very intuitive, robust terminal.but there is one drawback i ordered the \"blackberry z30 sta100-2\" and i received versions sta100-5 and lte, unfortunately, does not work in my country (poland). love it good service, recommended product basically inserted sim card and my son took from there. seems to be getting along with it just fine i brought this phone for my daughter and she loved it until she cracked the screen after only having it for a month. overall it\\'s a great phone. i would recommend it to others. works perfectly - great job! nice phone! easy to program and easy to use. this item works as described but i have become accustomed to a more advanced user interface on a cell phone. my wife loved this! i was very satisfied with amazon on the shipment and customer service. as far as the watch, i purchased it for my son to use with his iphone 4s. also i like the fact that you could put a sim card in it and use it as a phone. unfortunately when you put a sim card in it it doesn\\'t accept any of the services. also on the apple system it doesn\\'t really do much with bluetooth. if i was to do it all over again, i would have bought a samsung gear. i have a gear 2 and it does everything expected to do. i read some reviews before buying the phone and i could have been discouraged from buying it. the main reason i bought was because i was broke and the phone i was using suddenly began to mess up. someone said the battery was not very good and i serious usage i will say its a lie (suggestion turn off the battery percentage as it does not tell the truth sometimes). for $99 this phone is worth every penny. it\\'s not as fast as needed but hey i didn\\'t have to break the bank. one more thing when buying buy atleast a 16gb memory card with it ( you will need it) i am satisfied with my motorola razor maxx. it is sleek and lightweight. buen celular, todo excelente en cuanto a la funcion y compatibilidad, aca en vzla funciona fino, lo unico malo es el fleje ya se daño y toco comprar de repuesto. bought this for my girlfriend. she opted to get a new iphone instead but for the price, this phone does what i need it to do. finding accessories isn\\'t quite as easy as it is for the samsung galaxy but i won\\'t complain. the product is not what i expected, i thought it was gsm and cdma turns out that is, the information poublicada not say that type of technology or connect using the apparatus, reasoned that it was late to me by problems at customs, i could not contact the seller. not only was the phone a great price but even more than that was the person that sold it to me. i will never forget her kindness and caring. probably one of the best experiences i have ever had on any online store was extremely surprised how new it looked for a refurbished product. saved tons of money. doesn\\'t include earpods, but still a great deal! watch all in all is fine i cant access my txt msg threw bluetooth the headphones broke after first use theres a bit of a delay and the wall unit for me to plug in my usb cord was not in the box sim card was not in the box very good phone. i love all of my apple products and i love this phone! i have a lot of experience with apple though, so it is easy for me to run it. awesome piece of kit it\\'s good for the price. i love it but only problem wit charge so i went to apple store for replace new battery. there me go wit beautiful iphone but not a bad on scatch.. thk y so still working all the way excellent. i absolutely love this phone. the packaging was nice, it arrived on time and the new features are amazing. i was somewhat indecisive of whether i should purchase the iphone 6 or the note 5 nonetheless, i am happy with the choice i made great phone just doesn\\'t work with many carriers. love my phone.....but it is huge!!!! this phone is no longer working!!!!! put it on the charger overnight then went to turn it on the next morning but got nothing but a white screen! didn\\'t even last 2 months and it cannot be returned...what a joke. needless to say i\\'m highly disappointed and cannot just run out a buy another smart phone that fits my needs.the phone was not dropped or damaged...shame on you amazon! i recently bought a new lumia 920 and it is stunning. battery life is phenomenal (i use it mainly for sending emails, texting, some web browsing). the other day, i didn\\'t have to charge it for almost 2 days!! screen looks amazing, love that i can sync it with my other windows 8 devices. all in all, well worth the money. i\\'ve had my phone for several months and am really happy with it. i will buy my next phone from amazon! love it phone worked very well for the first month. now it is very very slow. i am very happy with this phone. it is responsive a and has a great camera. this phone is awesome i love it. it came on time, and was just what i was looking for. what i would suggest is sending the sim card with it though. i purchased this phone for my daughter, last november because her old cell phone was acting up. it worked fine until mid-may and the touch screen stopped working.sent e-mail through amazon on may 14 to masterdeals what was the way to get warranty service, its been one week and no reply. not an acknowledgement, nothing.what sets apart real customer service is how they treat the customer after the sale. i will not be buying from masterdeals again! i don\\'t like having to connect to a phone in order to use this item. without the phone it is just a watch. but i guess for the price it\\'s an ok watch. i bought that for somebody else so i don\\'t use it on a daily basis love love love my iphone 6 can make calls and send texts, also has an excellent fm radio. not quite the shade of blue i was expecting, but bright enough that i never loose it because it blends into a counter. good deal for its price, i would say, though very few tone or profile options. the phone doesnt work with my at&t sim card :( perfect i want to return my recent note 3 phone,just because is not working good for me,l can\\'t listening to my voice mail sometime internet don\\'t work. good very good you will find other details about how wonderful this cell is. i agree. the battery life is great, last 2 days for me with average use, mostly connected to wifi and less 4g. really fast, not to heavy at all. got this 32gb version and added a 64gb microsd. enough. and have 2 sim card (of course, only one of them with 4g online). two things that i hate from this asus cellphone--- first: very bad native original app for watching media; just download and app to replace it and done. but (and i love this from samsung and motorola) when you are watching media or worst, you give your cell to your child with a video, if you block the player (in order to prevent the exit from the video..) oops! if you touch any of the menu bottoms, you will stop the app and with the child, worst, will exit and go back to the cell menu or the main screen. you wont have this problem with samsung or moto, because when you block the cell while watching a video, those bottoms are kind or disable. and the second thing that i hate.... the on/off power bottom is too sensitive, you will find your cellphone rebooting beacuse you didnt notice that pushed it inside your pocket. this sensitive is worst with the case i bought: https://www.amazon.com/dp/b013hj2nc8/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_6 excellent smartphone i bought to my wife and she loves it excellent phone! very disappointed and feeling ripped off. i always loved samsung, i had this phone for not even 3 months. when i received the phone one side of the screen was raised, the glass wasn\\'t fully in the frame of the s5. then about 2 months later the power button went, it glitches. i never ever damaged it. i never dropped it, i\\'m very careful with phones..don\\'t waist your money i have purposely waited a while to write a review for this product. simply because i wanted to be sure it was perfect.. and it is! i was a note 2 user before purchasing this one. both i purchased through amazon and both were the international factory unlocked models. if you travel at all then this is what you will want. it is so simple to pop in a sim from whichever country you are going to be in and you are in business.i use line2.com services and so i do not need celllar service, just data and so using a sim card for an ipad works perfectly for me.as for the phone... it is fast, lightweight and so beautiful to look at. i love the feel of it in my hand as it is not slippery at all (compared to my friend\\'s iphone6) i use a very thin rubber cover that covers the back of it when i am out but always take it off when i am home as i love the feel of just the phone in my hand.. truly the king of the samsung lineup of phones. worth every $ in my opinion. first one came and was defective the camera would malfunction and the ui would constantly crash and bug out, replacement was sent next day got it on the metro pcs network and no complaints amazing phone for the price! blu is really stepping it up! i\\'d say it\\'s just as good and better then some flagships in 2016! ok phone... wife had a hard time using the device. kept dropping calls. well that was interesting! i took it to verizon and they said it could not be used for a verizon phone. hmmm... good paper weight?works with wi-fi device but not as a phone. phone doesn\\'t play sounds or ring total scam my order was for an unlocked htc, i have no usr for yjis phone.how can i return for an unlocked one??maximo boschbuenos aires, argentina excellent phone; lots of memory, crisp display, great camera and a very good value! the phone works great with my t-mobile carrier. only one problem- no matter how i set the date/time, it defaults back to 6/2/2011 and the time is 2 minutes short of the actual time. i\\'ve even pulled the batter and used the reset all function, but no luck. any suggestions? i love this phone..for $200 it\\'s worth it.the display is great. the screen is bright and sharp.sound is great. but sound low while your driving..my music sounds great too.i love the selfies cam especially the flash... but not so much the back cam..it looks a little funny but it\\'s ok..i love all the security features. i got the phone basically for the fingerprint scanner. i don\\'t use any of the other features because i\\'m scared illegal forget a password or something but if your into the tech stuff it\\'s awesome. plus a picture vault..it\\'s thin and light weight.at first i was disappointed about the size but the more i played with it the better it felt in my hand and now the size is perfect.the 1st few days or so i had the phone i wasn\\'t using it much and the battery lasted about 2 days with very light use. today i\\'ve used the phone for about 4hours and i\\'m at 61% (social media and pandora usage).. i may end up buying a battery pack for a back up.the phone speed is very fast. i love it..i\\'m having issues with apps and location because the phone is very sensitive.. but the gps does work very well and even tell you your route to work when it\\'s time for you to go..overall great phone and i\\'d buy again.i\\'m also with straight talk wireless and live in a wooded area. the phone works great.. phone is everything that is reported to be. very happy with it. my only complaint and it\\'s more of annoyance is the double tap on and off. unless you tap the exact spot it doesn\\'t turn on. great tool for classroom teachers. but apple needs to address ios update issues with their cameras and flashes. my first two used iphone 5ss looked great but had inoperable cameras! sellers were great and quickly refunded money. research showed thousands of 5s users have camera issues after updating their operating system. so, i\\'m not updating anytime soon until this is publicly addressed by apple. until then, i love my current 5s. the phone which sold me does not work on the lte network. you publish the networks with which operates the phone but he who sent me is not published .i think a lack of respect. unfortunately i am in venezuela and when i got the phone was very disappointed because it is not the one i bought .i wondered this because the first thing i saw was bought efore reputation. well i was wrong.thank you....... i purchased 2 of these, they arrived in 2 days! one is working perfect, one had a bad battery and had to be returned. they had my refund processed the same day! i will be ordering another one soon very responsable... great product good phone watchband broke for using few days thanks this is a great little phone. weighs under 2 oz on my postal scale. one star off for the recessed charging port that others have mentioned (had to take a utility knife to the case). going back to kitkat is a bit weird, but everything works great. i got this as a second phone to take running without weighing me down. switching sim cards takes a bit, but not too bad. too small for me to use as an everyday phone. would buy this brand again. all in all a great deal. the screen half of this slider phone was taped from the inside to the main part of the phone. not only did it fall completely apart within days, but the screen went white and the phone quit working altogether, (of course it couldn\\'t work, as it could not attach to the main part of the phone!) this is the worst experience i\\'ve ever had with a product i ordered from amazon. i certainly hope i get my money back quickly, so i can buy a decent phone. cute!!! ;) i have had this phone for over 6 months and it works great. i am not a person who does everything on their phone, but i can get my email, messages, etc. i have ran some google play apps and have not found anything that has not worked on it so far. it is a great starter smartphone for someone who wants a good basic smartphone that is not expensive. best bang for the buck i have found in a long time. it was great. no problems, just as advertised. conforme con la compra, era lo q esperaba con respecto al envio y tiempos de entrega todo excelente mucgas gracias. espero seguir teniendo buenas experiencias con ustedes nice phone, good price. it really helps. if you\\'re familiar with any of these lumia\\'s they are all virtually the same. purchased refurbished from redman, worked perfect. activated today on sprint, without a hitch! the customer service rep said, \"where did you get this phone? \" he could not believe it when i told him the price, it looked brand new! these phones work awesome on sprint, or flashed on page plus. great product this item would have been great if i had received it but i didn\\'t. empty box with all the accessory. the company was kind enough to reimburse me. if you wan to buy this phone then go ahead but be cautious best phone ever 100% recommended seller , excellent products and full responsibility , five star , excellent quality. bien i got this phone because it gives me a wifi spot without having to pay my prepaid unlimited carrier extra.thanks blu.if it had ncr i would have to implant this in my body. this is a great phone for the price! just keep that in mind!does a lot of everything, but the only thing really negative is that it can hold a 100% charge for not even 12 hrs. & can get hot! i love everything about this phone. i purchased this to replace my samsung s3 after i dropped it. the s3 is the size of the display screen on the j7 so i\\'m still adjusting to the larger size phone. the phone i received is exactly as described - dual sim slots and a memory card slot. i purchased this in gold and the color is exactly as shown on amazon. the phone is unlocked and works perfectly in the bahamas and i had no issues setting it up. i received a brand new phone in a sealed box 2 days after ordering it on prime. the seller also sent an email offering any support that may be needed. i would definitely recommend this phone. the phone works but unfortunately bluetooth does not and the battery life is a bit short. for an iphone it was decently priced and it is fine for my purposes as a back up phone. i just wish the bluetooth worked!!! :-(update: the battery no longer works and hasn\\'t in months so i this was a waste of money. i guess i should have been more concerned with the limited battery life when i first got the phone and returned it then. oh well it is an expensive lesson learned. excelente great new phone. love it im excited i just ordered and now i just gotta be patient i hope its good the quick charge capability does work after some time and after using it for about 2 month or less the battery quality has decreased significantly..... it takes very long to charge and dies within a couple of minutes i love this samsung galaxy s5 really everythingis fine & nothing problem, even the price is fair. excelente!! excellent ,too early to review i had no problems with the seller. it worked for my kitty wireless cellular service! awesome phone fast processor. but for this verizon or sprint users this phone is not compatible for those providers. attractive light weight case that protects the phone well. that for lady\\'s who like taking nudes late at night my daughter loves this phone. camera is awesome! for like a month i looked for a \"dumbphone\" to replace my \"smartphone\". i wanted to save money for more important things so i decided to ditch my 30 dollar required data plan........and i found this.wow, this phone i awesome. it looks sleek and modern, and it has some of the functions that a \"smartphone\" would have. it worked with at&t here in the us with a simple sim card switch. i love the qwerty keyboard and i am overall very happy with all the phone has to offer, except for the 2 megapoixel camera. i would be willing to pay more if the camera was like, 5 megapixels.this is the best \"dumbphone\" out there. not many us retailers will offer nokia phones because nokia has not cashed in on the \"smartphone\" with data plan scheme. good job nokia. for some odd reason, i am unable to send picture messages. i can send fb, messenger, ect. just not in a text..otherwise, i love it! good phone i like it, but this price is a little expensive. came as claimed. near flawless condition... i couldn\\'t find anything wrong with it if i tried. only thing is it came with a black back piece of aluminum... no apple logo or and writing, at all. but it grew on me its very sleek. phone operates as expected and is lightning fast. i would suggest to anyone. i got so excited getting this phone just to find out within minutes of getting it, it can not charge at all i was in need of a phone so i just saw all the good reviews i will never buy from these people ever again. excelent i love the phone and it came in early, but there are concerns. my phone upon the first boot up did not ask me to set the settings, and the language was already in taiwan chinese. there are also two stickers on the back of the phone which left some glue on the phone that was difficult to get rid of. so far i have not found any defect on it or anything missing, but it still bothers me a little bit that the phone was not completely in factory format mode. pros: it\\'s super fast, has a fingerprint scanner, takes an external sd card, can take your pulse, has a beautiful display, and was easy to set upcons: the menu buttons do different things than previous models which is still throwing me off, the auto brightness is way too dark in a dark room, there\\'s still some bloatware that can\\'t be disabled, and the ability to restrict app permissions was removedoverall i believe this was a great deal! loved it. got here on time and it\\'s everything i expected. thank you it ok for watching videos and things like that but it sucks there\\'s no flash and the camera quality is garbage. this sleek little bugger was a snap to activate--all i did was pop in my current sim card i was using with an unlocked moto q, power this baby up and in 2 minutes was sending and receiving calls and texts. (yeah i did charge it to 100% first.) i registered this thing at samsung\\'s web site and was shocked to see it only left the factory line 9 days before it was shipped! these arent some warehouse clearance specials, they are brand-new.i tested the 4g where it was available, and it was darn close to 2mbps, faster than my home dsl. i upped my tmobile plan and am looking forward to trying the wireless hotspot. there was no advertising or announcement that tmobile was rolling out 4g here in central florida. it works a lot of the main areas, not out in the boonies where i live...great phone, android gingerbread waaaaay faster than froyo...camera takes great pics, the built-in media player is nice w headphones. could have come with a better ringtone and wallpaper assortment. the google maps gps gets me in my yard to about a foot of real-life. sweet.the included data cable didn\\'t allow it to self-install drivers in windows 7 64-bit, so i downloaded the samsung new pc studio (yeah that\\'s what they call it) and then was able to browse the phone and add stuff to my sd card. i got a 32gb one somewhere at 32 bucks...so now i got me a touch-screen gingerbread mp3 player..that has a 4g phone built in!! for like 170 bucks less than the 32bg ipod. can\\'t beat that with a stick.one week update....okay, it\\'s been a week...the battery last pretty well if u keep a shortcut to task manager on the 1 home screen and shut stuff down when you\\'re done. the 4g speed is incredible when you have a good 4g signal (6mbps download at speedtest.net). the hotspot is a cinch to set up...i helped friends on boost with the galaxy prevail..while that\\'s a bang for the buck (was on sale at b.b. for 75...they look at mine and say i want dat.. the phone was in a good condition and seemed to be brand new. my brother-in-law is using the phone and is very happy on receiving it because he has been waiting 4 this phone ever since his old nokia 5800 xpressmusic broke down. thank you amazon.com and clc wholesale for delivering the phone on time. nice product @ a nice price. i was highly recommend this product as it truly an innovative device to own. excellent goods it is quite difficult to take off the back cover of the phone to put in the sim card/memory card and importantly the battery. otherwise it is a perfect match for my 64 year old grandmother. i recommend this product. i love the speed, it\\'s awesome the cell not turn, what connect appears that load turns off, i said to be batery bad wonderful product one of my all time favorite phones and trust me ive had quite a few !!! if you are the type of person who enjoys having a keyboard as well as the touch option i think you\\'ll like this one. perfecto this watch is cool. for the price, it is worth every penny. it is hooked to everything in my phone. although i could not figure out the browser. i dont think they even made it to work. instead of looking up bt notification apps in the play store, wait until your watch arrives and turn it on. scroll through and you will see an app qt. scan it and the app works flawlessly. i can connect to my phone from the watch with this app. all the other apps never worked so don\\'t waste your time. as for the looks, it is amazing. not too bulky or uncomfortable. sleek and the touchscreen works great. great product, fast shipping, great deal and excellent customer service. thanks. garbage bought 3 mobile for my siblings. after 2 months, mobile didn\\'t turn on. don\\'t buy this product and also not from this seller. phone has great features and is easy to use . for someone that does not need or want a smartphone . this phone is a great phone to have . the phone works very well in venezuela, it\\'s original package, i recommend great phone and transaction i loved the phone for 4 months then it just cut of and never truned back on... it didn\\'t have a virus, fell in water or on the floor nothing like that..this happened to a number of people so i would not advise getting any lg phone its not reliable... i bought this to replace my husband\\'s blackberry storm he lost in the airport. he is so please with it\\'s sleek design. he likes it a lot. so easy to use and surf the web too. a perfect little thing specially for a busy, always-on-the-go and not gadget freak person like him. this is our 2nd iphone 5 from this seller. the first phone came with almost no battery life, but was pleasantly returned & replaced. the replacement phone has more limited battery life than i would like, but not nearly as bad as the original. couldn\\'t update this phone can run very hot when charging. can be a bit dangerous. other than that, it\\'s a great android phone. very stylish and slim worked for about a week and then the tower signal started fading and disconnecting completely. 2g networks are supposed to become retired and its causing network problems. i was never able to run data trough phone. the positive is a trial on smart watch usage. when it works, it is great. bluetooth signal is weak and gets lost too easily though. i am very pleased with my phone because all my expectations were fulfilled, it\\'s a very good phone and i recommend it highly. she loves it like a newborn baby i recommend them are excellent and timely, and the phone came to me in perfect condition with all accessories and was super fast, thank you from venezuela this is actually the second time i have purchased this device. my father lost his first one and i purchased this one again. my father has dementia and is very comfortable using this device! what i like about it for him is the keypad is big- so it\\'s great for his eye sight. it\\'s basic and easy to navigate throughout the phone and the speaker is loud on the phone as well. excelente...... works as intended with no issues. what a phone. did a ton of research to choose between the galaxy note 5, galaxy s6 edge plus, lg v10, and this phone. i was looking for an android phablet that could work on both us (at&t) and china (china mobile) 4g. 4g knocked the lg v10 out. price and design knocked the s6 edge plus out. when it came down to the note 5 and the nexus 6p, i did a lot of reading and it basically came down to camera and novelty. from all of the comparisons i\\'ve read, both have amazing cameras and the 6p has definitely proven itself to me. coming from a galaxy s4, the novelty of the 6p won out. the note 5 would have been more of the same. in my opinion, the fingerprint reader location and camera on the 6p beat the note 5. speaking of the fingerprint reader, i never thought i\\'d want to lock my phone. it\\'s so easy though and works consistently well, that i\\'ve decided to use it. the only time it falters is with wet hands, but there\\'s always the pin for backup. the 6p\\'s regular operating system and security updates are a plus too. having a huawei phone for my time in china is another bonus. i can confirm the following: the h1512 international nexus 6p works well on both us at&t 4g and china china mobile 4g. the phone is super snappy. who cares that there\\'s not a \\'clear all\\' apps button, this phone knows how to do memory management, you\\'ll never have a need to manually clear an app from memory. the phone is also beautiful to look at with its amoled screen, and takes gorgeous still shots. i\\'ve already had a friend (who owns an s6) request that my phone be the one taking the group picture. despite not having optical image stabilization, the electronic image stabilization does a great job with videos. i was a little scared jumping into the phablet arena, but it hasn\\'t been a problem in the least. even fits into my skinnier jeans. is a real slim phone with a nice feel, i\\'d recommend the slimmest fitting spigen case, keeps the phone sexy while also keeping the glass off of surfaces and makes it easier to hold (it\\'s too slim without a case). the 3450 mah battery lasts a long long long long time. i rarely end a day below 30% battery, and i\\'m often around 50+%. fast charging is a godsend though most all new phones offer the same.want me to pick a negative? it\\'s panoramas; they\\'re not great. have yet to take one that doesn\\'t have some odd clipping or shape, and some are just downright bad. maybe panoramas on this phone work differently from phones i\\'ve had in the past and i just haven\\'t figured it out.couldn\\'t be happier. i hope this phone lasts me a long long time. congrats to huawei on making google\\'s first flagship quality nexus, now if only china would unblock google.... would be nice if amazon sold the 64gb version too. handy little thing. haven\\'t tried it internationally yet, but it looks great. a little slow on heavier apps and keyboard is a little small. makes a great backup travel phone, or a handy little mp3 player. earpiece speaker died after receiving. totally died after using 32 days. however, shipping is fast and response takes one day. just couldn\\'t be happier with product as advertized the phone did not come in an original tmobile box, but new. i initially had trouble setting up the password on the phone and went to tmobile to get it reset. other than that, the phone worked like it should. works really well .my husband said best father\\'s day gift. works awesome so far! excelent and perfect phone was missing the usb cable. i didn\\'t realize it until i got it home. the phone itself was fine. not much to say that hasnt been said many times over about this phone, but there is one factual error as it relates (only in the us) to the phone\\'s description on compatibility with phone service providers. this phone does in fact work with cricket (as cricket is a gsm mvno utilizing att\\'s gsm network).i myself am using it with cricket and have both the g925f and the att s6 edge and there is no noticable difference in mobile connection performance. the only thing to note is that with this phone, you must set the apn settings appropriately. the att s6 edge automatically detects and sets apn. it was great! brand new! no problems.... my husband brags about this phone all the time. glad he\\'s happy. honestly, this phone will work as a backup but the lack of ram makes it too slow to be useful for anything other than phone calls. even checking email is a cumbersome, frustrating event best left for when you get home and can use a tablet... or a laptop... or a desktop... or your tv remote... or virtually anything other than this device.on the plus side, i spent a lot less time on my phone while trying to use this device. i found myself stopping to smell the flowers, engaging in conversation with random people i didn\\'t even know (who i apparently work with) and even developed a taste for foreign cuisine as a result of getting irrevocably lost without google maps to guide me. i would be thankful save for almost losing my job when the time on the phone randomly changed to greenwich mean and the alarm failed to go off... while i was on the road... irrevocably lost...in reference to other reviews -no, you cannot use the sd card for appsthis phone is capable of hspa+the screen on time is short enough to not be worth the effort to test. s*** phone it get get frezzeed for no reseon phone works good great sound best with blue tooth although the stylist broke 2 days after i received it other then that get what you pay for price was right ... great condition, looks and works like brand new is also stop during you are using you have to turn off and them on to work again i like the unit so far. i\\'ve had it for about a month and some and it has been doing well. the antenna could do with a signal boost it tends to drop off when in certain places, more than other brands. i am also concerned with the fact that the phone screen can only be activated by the power button. a redundancy built in should have been considered. overall its a good buy for the price phone. no this didn\\'t work at all for me had to give it to a friend. great phone for the price.. big too.. very nice, fast and easy to use. better design and materials than galaxy s 4. seems stronger than competition. also wet and dust resistance. excelent serves its function, terrible sound quality through speaker. i think mine blew out or something. everything else works great. other than the quality control issue with the speaker, i have yet to contact blue about.. i have been using this phone for about 3 months. its decently fast, apps work great. would get 5 stars if call speaker didn\\'t blow out in the first week. question is would i buy it again? probably not. currently shopping for an lg or htc...update- contacted blu via email. waiting for reply 5/17. customer service so far is very impersonal. was really happy with the phone and then a month after warranty was up the camera quit and and hour later the screen quit. never buying a phone from here or online again. reached hgffghhhhhhhhjjffffghgasfgghjjj price worth the living excelente the phone came relatively quickly and has been working great this far (3months)however the cord that came with it doesn\\'t work any longer and i will need to go buy one, also never came with an adapter so that was an additional expense. other than that my daughter loves her phone and i think i want one too! problem whith the iphone, and problem geting my money back !!!!!! good nice phone. very sleek and nice and fast. definitely an upgrade from my s3. and i love the size. i highly recommend it although options for cases right now are pretty limited as it is not the most popular phone on the market. the product was in near perfect condition at an amazing price. thank you! this phone is a great buy; perfect for someone needing a smart phone but doesn\\'t have alot of money worked well for a while. stopped working after a few weeks. excellent, it is recommended to the community. lucky for future operations. so far, pretty good. only time will tell, but it\\'s a great phone. i had the nexus 5, so the 5x was a logical step up. i couldn\\'t get the transfer of apps to work during initialization. that\\'s the only complaint so far. the screen and camera are excellent. the battery life seems much better than on my old nexus. amazing phone i wanted to wait roughly 3 weeks to provide an accurate review of this cell phone. first, i love the note 5 and have always been a fan of the note series. however, i am not sure if this phone was a manufacture or seller refurbished phone giving that i did not want a refurbished phone. my proclamation of the phone possibly being refurbished is due to the fact that oftentimes the window usually the text message window would somewhat refresh itself (hard to describe, but the best way would be to imagine if you click the refresh button on a website on your computer and the screen will go transiently go blank then pop back up. that is what happens with the text messaging sometimes). also, the actually text keyboard randomly closes sometimes. not sure if it is a touch screen problem or digitizer problem, but it is sometimes annoying. the headphones that were sent with the phone were damaged and didn\\'t work properly. great cell phone. takes really good pictures. i like. very much. i got excellent phone. sealed not broken. new phone. and perfect unlocked phone. thank you. seller. very good it\\'s very good, working very well. i have had it for a short time but performing very well. would recommend just as advertised! sometimes it seems like the only cell phones out there are $600 iphones or $550 samsung galaxies. surely there are good phones out there at reasonable prices. well, this blu is one of them. i\\'ve had this one for a month now. to begin with, it\\'s a little bigger than i thought it would be. the screen is super crisp, sharp and hi-res. videos look great on it. next it has plenty of memory so loading a ton of apps is no problem. performance is very good - switching between apps is quick and all my apps are running great. connecting to t-mobile was a breeze. music is streaming through my lg bluetooth headphones flawlessly. google maps and the gps got me to my destination just fine. the fm radio is cool to have. one negative is the camera is not so great in some lighting conditions. in daylight it\\'s great, at night - not so much. and this is really nit-picking, but i like to use the volume controls as a shutter button, most phones let you do this, but not this one. i should be able to find an app for that.so in summary, this is a very solid, very capable phone at a great price for the price the product is not bad but if my phone is in my pants pocket i sometimes lose connection. i have yet to understand the pace count and why i cannot convert it to miles or why the product software that i downloaded to my phone doesn\\'t convert or sync either. again, for the price it aint that bad. my rating is price dependent. i\\'ve been an iphone user since the iphone 3 came out. i updated to an iphone 6 last year and have been pleased with the larger size . we just retired and another spendy phone for my wife\\'s old eyes isn\\'t in the budget. she got the 6 and i got the blu. only had it for 3 days and i am amazed at the quality for $89 . it has a beautiful screen and a very solid feeling. it has no lte , so big data users wouldn\\'t be happy . i\\'ve been seeing about 4 mbps download speeds with cricket which is plenty for me. if i get a year out of the phone at this price then all is good. i chose this phone because of it\\'s smaller, more portable size, and it has worked perfectly so far. it has many new, up to date features with the same reliability as any other android. shipping was fast and efficient, and the box comes with everything you need to get started. this is a great phone from a great company, and i would recommend it to anyone! i received the phone today. its actually for my girlfriend and right away she loved it. from what i see the phone is awesome, maybe even better than my galaxy mega 2! so far so good!great buy, prompt delivery. i love amazon!! i received my phone and in no time had it set up i\\'ll be adding a 2nd sim card soon and will be fully utilizing all of the features this phone has to offer. love my new polaroid a6! this iphone product didn\\'t meet my expectations at all. there were many damages around the phone casing, and the main speaker, on the front screen, wasn\\'t working properly. also the phone over-heats; not to mention the battery life drains faster than usual. unfortunately my experience was bad, yes the phone was delivered on time, and visually everything was ok. but when i tried to connect to my home wifi i noticed that it didnt work, i tried everything but nothing. since i was naive enough to by this phone without an international warranty (i live in venezuela), trusting other reviews now im stuck with this phone and i had to send it to a technician on my expense to see if he can fix it.bottom line, don\\'t buy phones that dont have warranty, i should have known better, why no warranty? very fishy.back to my faithful iphone!oh! and i wrote to this seller to seek help and they never wrote back. i got a very bad deal.venezuelan buyers i would not recommend this seller at all. i have the phone two weeks now and has met my expectations great phone. touch screen too sensitive - when held to ear, hits keys continually. would not purchase again, because also end up hanging up on people if head cheek touches the correct button. just what i wanted......excellent features. loved it... i hated it & returned it because...poor voice reception on t-mobile in metro orlando; non-adjustable crippled ascending ring; no camera flash; no auto-focus camera; short battery life; not a good value even for a starter phone at this price point.motorola designed this feature-crippled cheapie cell phone for emerging markets like india and that\\'s where it should stay...not really appropriate for the u.s. market. it took a few calls to get this thing fully functional with our net 10 service and the sim card from my wifes old phone only partially worked after being cut to fit this phone. i had to order a new micro sim card from amazon for .99 and now its working great. my understanding is that this problem is unique to net 10 sim cards as they become married to the phone they come in. after overcoming this minor annoyance and the short wait for the new sim we are very happy with this phone and highly recommend it. amazing product! cams early! its cool cell only lasted five months , plate damaged this was a gift for my son. he really likes the phone and keeps it close by all the time. love my new phone! works great, i don\\'t think i am even using all of the features it has. great phone would recommend to anyone. didn\\'t like phone or seller. great phone awesome stuff. phone is great condition. fast shipping.thank you. i\\'m not much of a reviewer...highly reccommed people. my order came extremely fast! everything was perfect as described and works just great! i highly recommend buying from this seller the item in question was not an issue but the programs installed where, i couldn\\'t get it to accept my messages and it had to install apps that i could figure out what they did. hard to transition from an iphone but after two weeks. really like the galaxy yes but now i gave it to my granddaughter as i traded it in for the 6! a wonderful phone, works perfectly.fast shipment. $68，a little expensive. and the word is very little. windows 8 is not convinient. the serviso is bad, there is absent loader, earphone, cd, original manual, card of 2 gb, the secondhand battery, the box was adulterated i bought this phone in november 8, 2015, but i have been having problems with my carrier because it wants a receipt where i support the imei i have, i need help with this, it it possible? my cellphone works perfectly i do not have any problem with it but i need that information quickly, thank you. wow! i could not believe i got a used iphone 5 with not a single scratch !! it\\'s in new condition and came with the wall charger plus a case matching the color. i honestly couldn\\'t believe what spectacular shape it was in and not expensive for and iphone 5 at all! shipped in 2 days and in excellent working condition, i swear it has to be new !!! 110% satisfied customer right here !! this phone claims to be unlocked. do not believe it. this phone is not unlocked. i inserted my verizon sim card and it wold not work. i went online for assistance to switch the lines and they could not figure it out. i called verizon and they could not figure it out and finally took it to a verizon store where they told me it was not verizon compatible. do not buy this product. perfect! it got here sooner than expected and it has been really amazing!!!! awesome i\\'m not sure how i bought this phone for $350 with 64 gigabytes of internal memory but i did ........and it works perfectly on verizon wireless.....can\\'t beat it........ came in great condition.....wife loves it. love it great phone and it was shipped on time and the phone is in great condition as promised. never liked iphones but now i love them. very happy with purchase! fine have no problems the product are awesome, i have not used them yet. arrived early .. only took 3 days.. perfect.. only needed to charge an down load update 1 1/2 hrs later she\\'s one of my favorite things i\\'ve had this phone for about a week and i absolutely love it. it has the best specs of any phone on the market, and noticeably so! i put the device to work to see what it was really capable of; opened a ridiculous amount of apps, streaming video, etc. it did not hesitate one bit. opened and ran everything smoothly, unlike any phone i\\'ve ever seen. and it doesn\\'t even cost half of what the new phone market leaders are selling their latest product for! do not underestimate this phone because of its affordable price, it is simply amazing and i would recommend over and over again. love the phone i have three of these, and they are great phones.i bought another, and did not get what is advertised. most other buyers don\\'t, either. the phone listed is a \\'us version with warranty.\\' many (most/all?) of what is being shipped are not us phones. the problem with that is that nokia\\'s one year limited us warranty applies only to us phones. you may not know this until you try to get warranty repair service, as other reviewers here have noted. but a call to nokia with the iemi number will tell whether you have a us phone or not.amazon is aware that shipped phones routinely don\\'t match the description, and won\\'t do anything about it. so do your homework and don\\'t be deceived. if a factory warranty is important to you, this is an unreliable source. really low quality build, dont fit and wrong product, because the seller (wirester) intentionally send the wrong item without my approval.when i asked \"why you send me the wrong item?\", wirester said the one i ordered was out of stock, so they send a different product.i know it\\'s only $5 phone case, but the way they do business is not right.the phone case i receive totally different graphic then the one displayed. also the phone case cant close completely.it seems its a bit too small or not tall enough by a bit. so one end always open up cant be closed or clamped completely.i gave them 2 star, because they told me to return it and they cover the shipping. the cellphone overheats a lot specially when playing games i had to remove the sillicon protector and still heat goes up to 50cº, other than that everything else its ok.battery life its good 24hrs for light use although gmaps consumes a lot, recommend desabling gps if dont needed.delivery was ok, 2 day shipping on time. the product received was not what was shown. it was very greatly used and not in very good condition. i will not purchase another product from this company. i need a qwerty keyboard for texting capabilities. this phone does the trick. nice camera and decent phone call reception. i bought this phone before few days and it\\'s tottaly broken and screen doesn\\'t work. on first look it was good, but after few days the problems comes out. screen is shaking, moving left and right without touch, and it\\'s not accurate. i\\'m going to refund and i\\'m tottaly disappointed, also i didn\\'t get accessories and charger is not original. excellent rating based on phone itself!just in case anyone in the states is wondering, regardless of what lte bands it says works they are not compatible with any usa lte bands, ive tried several tweaks, and modifications its simply not the same frequencies. anyone hoping to use this on tmobile will only get hspa+ at best. from other research the same can be said about att network.avoid like the plague if lte is a must, and you\\'re in the states.other wise this phone is brilliant. first off, be sure you receive a d620r and not a d620k which drops the 800mhz lte band needed for europe. go to settings/about phone/hardware to verify the model.pros:1. small physical size for a 4.7\" display.2. bright display - you can see the pixels but they are small.3. the included file manager can read/write to the external_sd card.4. accepts 64gb microsd cards - just tap the error notification and the phone will reformat it to fat32.5. operation is snappy and it plays all the videos i tried smoothly.cons:1. no light sensor so only manual brightness control.2. small 8gb internal storage leaving only 3gb for you.overall, i am pleased with this lg g2 mini phone. bueno excellent, thanks for the phone .. it\\'s in top top condition......looks new. fantastic irresponsible at the time of delivery ,i do not recommend them great camera, awful os. windows 10 on this is like running windows me on a current flagship pc. no have spanish language, this phone, its a great problem for me. in the page this fone dont have a specificatios the languages the 5 start rating i am giving this is considering that it is cheap. for 99 bucks this is an amazing phone, but you will be disappointed if you compare it to a $500+ device like an iphone 6 or galaxy s6.i am floored at the capability and quality at this price point. honestly at this low of a price i expected that it would be a piece of junk that i would be sending it back. the mass of positive reviews convinced my to give it a try. after 2 months i am hooked on blu. i\\'m never getting a phone on contract or overpaying for a phone again.pro- value for money- camera quality- android 5.0- minimal bloatware- included silicon case and screen cover- screen qualitycon- a little slow. slim, light and great mobility. no tried to figure out how to return it. it download a lot emails from my yahoo. the the yahoo was no longer download and i could figure it out. went to att store for help they couldn\\'t help at all. then bought a head set and doesn\\'t recognize it\\'. now i\\'ve order an att smartphone. excellent could bem the right charger, im from brazil and is totaly different, i had to buy a new charger. bought this phone mainly for a back up phone. my main device is the studio c 5.0 hd i do prefer that device. there are a couple things about the lollipop system that i am not a fan of, but overall the the device functions as it should. really nice phone like it hope there will be upgrades soon. works great. i would buy from this buyer again. ......is not sold as advertised. this phone is not unlocked in that sense we are all familiar with. the phone contains a ridiculous amount of at&t\\'s stuff (i\\'m with tmobile). the stuff is embedded everywhere, even in the internet connection settings, proxies, etc. you get errors with almost everything. yes, there are ways you can reconfigure for t-mobile but why go through all of that? the camera is acceptable in good lighting and close proximity but the flash is weak, total darkness. what kills this phone for me are no 3.5mm hole for my headset and the inability (as far as i know) to select multiple texts, pictures, etc for deletion. you have to press backspace and confirm delete, the most annoying procedure ever.i regret the purchase, but will keep the phone for 2 reasons......the mp3 player is solid and the phone\\'s hardware and looks are admirable. this phone is only worthy of 1 star. too bad, because i love candybar qwerties.'"
